Title = {The relationship between low-consumption single-use plastic awareness

Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to combine two theories, the Theory of Planned
   Behaviour (TPB) and the Norm Activation Model (NAM), to investigate the
   relationship between the awareness of reducing single-use plastic
   waste's environmental cost and the behaviour to limit the use of
   single-use plastic products (SUPPs) by FPT university
   students.Design/methodology/approachQuantitative research methodologies
   were employed on a sample of 506 university students. The survey data
   was then examined using SPSS, SPSS AMOS and SmartPLS
   software.FindingsThe overarching conclusion of the study is that
   awareness of reducing single-use plastic waste's environmental cost has
   a positive impact on FPT university students' behaviour to reduce their
   use of single-use plastic products. Another intriguing discovery is how
   socialisation of responsibility affects pro-environmental behaviour
   through the interplay between personal norms, subjective norms and
   behavioural intention.Originality/valueThis study on the relationship
   between SUPP low-consumption awareness and behaviour and mediating
   factors is a necessary foundation for future studies related to changing
   the behaviour of students using SUPPs. That will also be a solid
   foundation for practical plans to change behaviour using SUPPs through
   communication campaigns to increase awareness.},

Abstract = {Introduction Climate change is a major issue facing the global
   population. Healthcare services, including dentistry, have an obligation
   to examine current practice and reduce the carbon footprint of their
   services. Single-use plastics, for example, those used to cover dental
   equipment, are not necessarily essential for cross-infection
   purposes.Materials and methods This quality improvement project was
   carried out in 2023 across 12 dental practices in the North London
   dental foundation training scheme. Baseline financial and environmental
   costs were estimated for the weekly single-use barrier plastics used in
   each practice. This was communicated to each practice. Practices using
   single-use plastics were contacted three months later to see if they had
   made any changes.Results In total, 10 out of 12 practices were using one
   or more of the single-use plastics at baseline, with an estimated carbon
   footprint ranging from 0.07-27.02 kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e)
   per week. Three practices reduced or eliminated their single-use
   plastics as a result of this quality improvement project, which resulted
   in an equivalent saving of 46.87 kg CO2e per week.Discussion and
   conclusion The use of single-use plastic barriers varies widely between
   dental practices and is associated with a financial and environmental
   cost. Infection control guidelines are unclear with their
   recommendations. The authors urge dental services to reduce their
   single-use plastic barriers and would encourage infection control
   guidelines to consider the environmental impact when making
   recommendations.
   Readers will gain an insight into the financial benefits of reducing the
   use of unnecessary single-use plastics in a dental practice.Readers will
   see the benefits of the removal of single-use plastics using real-world
   examples.Readers will be exposed to the environmental benefits of
   reducing the use of unnecessary single-use plastics in a dental
   practice.Readers will gain clarity on the cross-infection guidelines in
   relation to single-use plastics.},

Abstract = {Poor waste management and unsustainable institutional and individual
   behaviors, have led to the accumulation of plastic litter in many
   habitats worldwide. Assessment of plastic pollution in Kenyan marine
   environment was conducted focusing on the impact of banning the
   single-use plastic carrier bags in Kenya. The quantification,
   composition, and distribution of plastics were determined at nine (9)
   beaches along Kenyan coastline using standing stock method. A total of
   750 plastic items were collected and categorized with only 47 pieces
   being single-use plastic carrier bags. A great number of plastics (n =
   383), were identified by their original use, with packaging plastics
   being the most common (n = 155). Macroplastics were the overall dominant
   plastics at 76\%, mesoplastics, 21\% and microplastics, 3\%, which were
   altogether dominated by low-density polyethylene (LDPE) at (46\%),
   followed by polypropylene (PP), 30\%; polyethylene tetraphthalate (PET),
   9\%; polyvinyl chloride (PVC), 8\%; and polystyrene (PS), 7\%. The
   absence of identifiable single-use plastic carrier bags in 6 out of 9
   beaches signified the effectiveness of the ban in Kenya. Monitoring of
   trends and sources of plastic debris is encouraged to help enhance the
   science-policy linkage aimed at reducing marine plastic pollution.},

Abstract = {The single-use plastic bag is the most legislated item of plastic in the
   world, banned in over 92 countries. The bans are largely concentrated in
   Africa and the Caribbean, where the plastic bags are often black and the
   plastic footprints small. The bans have destabilised essential economic,
   social, and technical arrangements of marginalised communities reliant
   on plastic engagements and adaptations to improvise against multiple,
   overlapping, incursive forms of violence. This article seeks to
   understand the spatial and material nature of these legislative actions
   and the particular item of single-use plastic they target. Acknowledging
   the (spatialised) material realities of the single-use plastic bag, this
   article argues that these bans are a legislative response to the black
   plastic bag as spatialised, racialised, sexualised, abject Other.
   Drawing from monster theory, the article reflects on the trans-corporeal
   body burdening of black plastic bags and the black hands, black bodies,
   black markets, and black, corrupt, illicit actions with whom and which
   they are associated. Reconceptualising the (black) single-use plastic
   bag as an agape, plastic monster that defines, patrols, and transgresses
   cultural/economic boundaries, this article calls for making explicit the
   vermicular activities within economic marginalisation and distinguishing
   them from the discursively constructed amorphous, tentacled mass.},

Abstract = {As consumers increasingly access takeaway food from restaurants, the
   importance of reducing the use of single-use plastic has emerged. To
   investigate this complex process, the current study applies the Theory
   of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Norm Activation Model (NAM) to
   discover how this theory and model leads to discovering customers'
   behavioral intentions. Data were collected from 436 respondents and
   reflect people aged 18 years or older who accessed an online food
   ordering platform within the three months prior to the study data
   collection. Results present that customers' attitudes, subjective norms,
   perceived behavioral control, awareness of consequences, and personal
   norms regarding reducing single-use plastic utensils influence
   consumers' behavioral intentions. These findings are meaningful to
   academia in providing insights into the link between consumers' behavior
   and reducing the use of single-use plastic utensils in the restaurant
   context. In addition, this study provides marketing strategies and
   implications for improving consumers' awareness of the use of single-use
   plastic utensils in retail food services.},

Abstract = {Human health and marine life are facing the hazards and threats of
   plastic waste. China is the world's largest producer and consumer of
   disposable plastic products, thus paying more attention to the threats
   and challenges of single-use plastics products in China is urgent. This
   study aims to explore the intention to purchase single-use plastic
   products based on the theory of planned behavior. Data collection using
   self-reported questionnaires, and 402 valid questionnaires were
   obtained, thus analyzed using Amos 22.0 and SPSS 18.0 software. Results
   indicate that attitude, perceived behavioral control, normative social
   influence, informational social influence, and positive anticipated
   emotion positively affect intention to purchase single-use plastic
   products. Meanwhile, positive anticipated emotion positively moderates
   the relationship between normative social influence and intention to
   purchase single-use plastic products, but negatively moderates the
   relationship between informational social influence and intention to
   purchase single-use plastic products. This research provides some
   theoretical and policy implications to help relevant agencies design
   targeted interventions to address environmental issues related to
   single-use plastic consumption.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of external
   and internal factors on intentions to avoid single-use plastic bags.
   Data were collected using online survey from 703 consumers in India
   using convenience sampling method. The results indicated that green
   advertisements, retailers' incentives, government policies (external
   factors), and extrinsic motivations and subjective norms (internal
   factors) had significant positive effects on intentions to avoid
   single-use plastic bags. The results of this study provide important
   implications to governments, policymakers, retailers, and the consumers
   to develop a sustainable eco-system.},

Abstract = {Guatemala is severely polluted with plastic waste, with open burning,
   illegal dumping, and leaking landfills causing widespread harms. What
   actions, this article asks, are local people taking to reduce this
   pollution? What, more broadly, does this suggest for the power of
   grassroots environmentalism to influence plastics governance in
   Guatemala? Drawing on fieldwork in 2023 and 2024, our study finds that
   local efforts to eliminate single-use plastics have been surging across
   Guatemala since 2016. Formidable political and industry forces, however,
   are limiting the scaling up of these efforts. This article, the first to
   investigate the politics of reducing single-use plastic waste in
   Guatemala, deepens the understanding of the agency and power of local
   people in the Global South to shape environmental governance while
   emphasizing the importance of accounting for the political and economic
   forces thwarting the scaling up of community actions.},

Title = {Industry-Challenge to Pro-Environmental Manufacturing of Goods Replacing
   Single-Use Plastic by Indian Industry: A Study Toward Failing Ban on
   Single-Use Plastic Access},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {77336-77346},
Abstract = {One important topic that raised concern among researchers and population
   is the threat posed by the widespread presence of single-use plastic
   items, which has become a part of day-to-day life. An urgent need is to
   build a plan by manufacturers/ investors to give a due concern over
   environmental preservation. A number of challenges are yet to be
   addressed for implementation of sustainable manufacturing concerned with
   environment; this is a matter of worry. Prime minister of India on 150th
   anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi has urged the nation to make India free of
   single-use plastics. On July 1, 2022, India banned single-use plastic
   items that have low utility but are frequently littered around, such as
   plastic straws. Work done in this research is undertaken for finding the
   prominent challenges which are faced in the eco-friendly sustainable
   manufacturing practices in single-use plastic industries. It is also a
   matter of concern that why a ban on certain single-use plastic with low
   utility is failing in India?. A framework has been made on Triangular
   Fuzzy Number (TFN) based fuzzy method to identify and rank the
   associated problems/ challenges. Triangular fuzzy numbers are effective
   in modelling imprecise and uncertain information, and have been widely
   applied in decision making. In this work 13 challenges have been
   identified and ranking is done using TFN to find the most prominent
   factors. From results it is very clear that Expense on implication,
   Scantiness in the support received from the government and Lack of
   environment concern among suppliers are the most influencing factors/
   challenges. Works done on identification of challenges will be of help
   to policy makers and industrialists in identification of core issues.},

Title = {The First Step of Single-Use Plastics Reduction in Thailand},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Single-use plastics reduction is the primary mission of SDG promotion in
   Thailand. This study discusses the implementation and challenges of
   plastics reduction campaigns through interviews and field investigations
   focusing on stakeholder participation and perceptions of policy
   approaches in Bangkok. Convenience and economic factors are the major
   challenges for reduction practices in addition to insufficient financial
   support and the weak participation of stakeholders, all of which lead to
   the avoidance of penalties, reliance on voluntary collaborations, and
   market-led measures. The implementation of a ban without preparation
   guidelines for alternatives, practices, and an unequal regulatory scope
   has created tensions for consumers and businesses. Suasive instruments
   drawing on consumer merit, emotion, and ethics, in addition to
   incentives that lead to the perception of benefits related to single-use
   plastics reduction, could provide a motivation for society and shift
   current behaviors. Policymakers need to collaborate with academics and
   NGOs to provide the private sector and consumers with detailed,
   suitable, and short- and long-term strategies that promote
   pro-environmental behavior, encourage reuse, and discourage single-use
   practices-including clear duration times, targets, detailed guidelines,
   and facilities. The combination of a ban and a penalty, while still
   offering a fee as an alternative option and maintaining acknowledgment
   and communication with stakeholders, would result in better consumer
   feedback.},

Abstract = {This study involves a material flow analysis (MFA) of single-use
   plastics (SUPs) and packaging materials in the Republic of Korea,
   focusing on their short lifespans and significant contributions to
   plastic waste. Based on the MFA results, recommended policies for
   managing packaging materials and SUPs were proposed. In 2021, 6.340 Mt
   of synthetic resin were produced, with 39.7\% (2.518 Mt) utilized for
   packaging materials and SUPs. The per capita consumption of these
   materials was 48.7 kg/year, surpassing global averages. The separate
   collection rate was 54.6\%, with films (26.2\%) and manufacturing
   facilities (10.6\%) exhibiting the lowest rates. The overall recycling
   rate was 52.7\%, and 981 t of recycled waste was directly placed in
   soil. The reliability of the MFA results was estimated to be 83.1\%,
   which is an improvement compared to previous studies. Recommendations
   include reducing plastic use, expanding recycling infrastructure,
   raising public awareness, and implementing stricter regulations to
   control soil contamination.},

   single-use plastic bag? A case study of express delivery packaging in

Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The rapid growth of employing single-use plastic delivery bags (SPDBs)
   as express delivery packaging has led to serious resource depletion and
   environmental pollution. To mitigate these environmental threats,
   reusable plastic delivery boxes (RPDBs) were developed as an alternative
   option. This study utilized the life cycle assessment method to compare
   the environmental impacts of RPDBs and SPDBs. The results indicated that
   RPDBs cause fewer environmental impacts than SPDBs during intra-city
   delivery but higher impacts during inter-city delivery. Greenhouse gas
   emissions from plastic production were found to be the largest impact
   contributor, mainly from fossil energy generation during primary plastic
   pelleting. Increasing the average number of reuse cycles of RPDBs to 50,
   by 2025, would generate 6.24 million kg CO2-eq but could reduce CO2-eq
   emissions by 309.3 million kg and tons of plastic wastes by 0.96
   million, compared to using SPDBs.},

Abstract = {The widespread use of single-use plastic food wrapping and drinking
   straws has led to significant plastic and microplastic pollution,
   threatening environmental sustainability and human health. This study
   aims to provide sustainable alternatives by improving starch-based
   biofilms' mechanical properties and water resistance for food wrapping
   and edible drinking straws. We modified starch with chitosan, raw
   seaweed, and sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) to enhance these biofilms.
   Our results show that the optimal proportion of chitosan, combined with
   varying seaweed and STPP content, significantly improves the biofilms'
   properties. The developed starch-based biofilms offer an eco-friendly
   and sustainable alternative to single-use plastic, with the potential
   for large-scale, cost-effective production.Highlights Novel edible
   starch-based biofilms were successfully prepared. The biofilms made from
   renewable FDA-approved edible materials. Biofilms showed improved
   mechanical properties and water resistance. The biofilms exhibited
   non-toxic and antimicrobial properties. Biofilms offer alternatives to
   single-use plastic for food wrapping.
   Edible starch-based biofilms with enhanced water resistance and
   mechanical properties were created by incorporating chitosan, seaweed,
   and sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP). These biofilms provide an
   eco-friendly, sustainable alternative to single-use plastic for food
   wrapping, with potential for large-scale, cost-effective production.

Abstract = {Single-use plastics have become interconnected with human populations
   globally, yet, studies on plastic pollution and practices have
   predominantly been conducted outside Africa. This study explored
   perceptions of single-use plastics at the University of the
   Witwatersrand, with 1398 respondents in an online survey and 18 in a
   solicited diary during 2019. Despite social media and research exposure
   amongst university students, only 57\% of respondents were familiar with
   the term single-use plastics. However, respondents displayed
   considerable pro-environmental attitudes relating to plastic pollution
   and recycling. These attitudes did not translate into pro-environmental
   behaviour in daily life, whereby 88\% of respondents believed that
   single-use plastics are used with too many products, yet, only 22\%
   avoid products which incorporate them. Respondents faced constraints in
   their pro-environmental behaviour relating to recycling infrastructure,
   re-use and the expense of alternative products. Negative perceptions
   exist towards single-use plastics in South Africa due to their
   ubiquitous pollution and presence in daily consumption practices.
   Increased pro-environmental behaviour provides an opportunity to curb
   plastic pollution and rethink consumption patterns. However, changing
   attitudes alone to stem the tide of plastic consumption and pollution
   will be meaningless without supportive recycling infrastructure from the
   government and reduced single-use, non-recyclable plastic production.},

Abstract = {Wicked problems pose both immediate and existential threats. Within this
   article we explore the underlying nature of wicked problems, including
   the social traps embedded in them. We deconstruct the ecosystem
   surrounding single-use plastics to make key points regarding
   controversies and conflicting interests surrounding wicked problems. We
   propose that wicked problems may be reframed by unpacking the
   relationships between individuals and collectives and how social traps
   are understood in terms of time horizon, ownership, responsibility, and
   involvement. We argue that resolutions to social traps are paramount to
   resolving wicked problems in the case of single-use plastics and to
   wicked problems more generally. We draw from marketing, psychology,
   public policy, and consumer research literature to suggest specific ways
   marketing can mitigate or perhaps eliminate the insidious dynamic of
   social traps and wicked problems, and in turn affect positive outcomes
   to enhance the short-term and long-term well-being for many consumers
   and stakeholders.},

Title = {Single-use plastic bag alternatives result in higher environmental
   impacts: Multi-regional analysis in country with uneven waste management},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {171},

Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Single-use plastics (SUPs) have been the focus of plastic pollution
   control, and limiting their use while shifting to other alternatives
   have been widely promoted in various countries. This study tries to
   verify the life cycle environmental performances of single-use plastic
   bag and its alternatives under different scenarios in real world. China
   is chosen as case study, where provincial variability is prominent in
   waste disposal, and strictest plastics ban has issued lately in this
   worldwide biggest market. The study found that HDPE plastic bags have
   relatively lowest environmental footprints regarding to Acidification
   Potential, Global Warming Potential, Chemical Ox-ygen Demand,
   Eutrophication Potential, Fossil Fuel Depletion Potential and Water Use.
   Sticking to current waste treatment, large-scale promotion of degradable
   products will increase environmental impacts by 1.4-22.6 times
   nationwide. Xinjiang has highest impact of using plastic bag at
   household level, due to its long-distance transport and high landfill
   ratio. Henan and Hebei will trigger the most significant changes in
   Global Warming Potential of 4.6 and 4.4 times if single-use plastic bags
   are all replaced with other alternatives. Uncertainty and sensitivity
   test further prove the robustness of results, and extends geographical
   implications of the findings. These suggest that introduction of new
   alternatives requires systematic deployment with full life cycle
   thinking, and SUPs pollution control should be a holistic
   transformation. Reducing bag weight while ensuring carrying capacity,
   purchasing local products to shorten transportation distances and
   shifting towards cleaner energy sources are synergetic ways to reduce
   the environmental impact of single-use plastic products.},

Title = {What potential does the EU Single-Use Plastics Directive have for
   reducing plastic pollution at coastlines and riversides? An evaluation
   based on citizen science data},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {To address environmental pollution by plastic litter, the European Union
   adopted EU Directive 2019/904, the so called ``Single-Use Plastics
   Directive{''} (SUPD), which bans several single-use plastic products and
   addresses additional items with measures such as extended producer
   responsibility and obligatory requirements for product redesign. This
   study assessed the potential of the SUPD to reduce litter pollution in
   the environment with three scenarios. The ``best case{''} scenario
   assumed that all measures of the SUPD completely prevent targeted items
   from getting into the environment. Another scenario assumed that no
   measures besides bans were effective. An intermediate scenario assumed
   partial effectiveness of measures. Data of almost 5,000 sampling events
   from citizen science protocols (Plastic Pirates, International Coastal
   Cleanup, Marine Litter Watch) and the OSPAR protocol were used to
   analyse litter at riversides and coastlines in Germany and the European
   Union. 44 to 68\% of litter items in citizen science protocols consisted
   of single-use plastics (cigarette butts were the most prominent items).
   At coastlines sampled by the OSPAR protocol, fishing gear and undefined
   plastics prevailed. The scenario analysis revealed that substantial
   litter reductions could be achieved in the ``best case{''} scenario
   (upwards of 40\%), while the intermediate scenario resulted in litter
   reductions of 13 to 25\%. The marginal effect of the ``only bans{''}
   scenario achieved a reduction of 2-6\% in Germany and the European
   Union, respectively. Thus, depending on implementation and enforcement,
   the current SUPD can be an important first step, yet further legislative
   actions are needed to effectively prevent plastic waste pollution.},

Funding-Text = {The present study could not have been realized without the enthusiastic
   support of schoolchildren, teachers, and volunteers collecting litter
   data at riversides in Germany - their collaboration is greatly
   appreciated (see Supplemental material 1) ! Likewise, we appreciate all
   the effort from contributors to the International Coastal Cleanup, the
   Marine Litter Watch, and the OSPAR datasets. In this regard, we also
   wish to thank the Ocean Conservancy, the European Environmental Agency
   and the OSPAR Commission for making their litter data publicly
   available. Many people throughout the years contributed to the Plastic
   Pirates project, we are grateful to colleagues from Kiel Science
   Factory, the Ecologic Institute, the German Aerospace Centre, and
   familie redlich! Discussions with Mateja Grego (National Institute of
   Biology, Slovenia) , Meritxell Abril Cuevas (University of Vic, Spain)
   and Carla Lourenco (Ciencia Viva, Portugal) were important for the
   assessment of single-use plastics at riversides. We are grateful for the
   comments by three anonymous reviewers which have helped to substantially
   improve this manuscript. Funding for the present study came from the
   Federal Ministry of Education and Research in Germany (BMBF) . MT was
   sup- ported by the European Union's H2020 research and innovation
   programme MINKE project (under Grant Agreement No 101008724) .},

Abstract = {Plastics have become a significant threat to natural ecosystems as well
   as human health. The use and consumption of plastics improves our
   quality of life significantly, but it is critical to transition to more
   sustainable alternatives. Thus, the current study proposes an
   investigation into the impact of single use plastic products during
   pandemic on the impact to the environment from the Malaysian and Libyan
   perspective. A pilot study was conducted to examine the strength of the
   questionnaire in collecting on the environmental impacts of single use
   plastic during COVID-19 pandemic distributed across two countries (Libya
   and Malaysia). SPSS was used to test the questionnaires' strength with
   40 participants, 20 in each nation. The reliability test results with
   Cronbach's Alpha predicted values of 0.7-0.86 and actual data Alpha
   values 0.87-0.93, normal test of variance inflation factor ranging
   between 1 and 5, skewness and kurtosis values of -1.343 to -0.076 and
   5.312 to -0.024 respectively confirmed the strength of the
   questionnaires as benchmarked in the literature. Further, the
   participants' responses to the quality of the questionnaire in
   determining the single use plastic impact to environmental have clearly
   revealed the strength and applicability of this questionnaire for wider
   data collections.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes NielsenIQ household scanner data, exploring the
   environmental motivation behind organic food consumption using
   single-use plastics spending as a proxy for environmental concern. To
   investigate the relationship between the two environmental behaviors,
   organic food and single-use plastic, the study utilizes the instrumental
   variable approach to account for the potential endogeneity in revealed
   preference data. Results show a significant negative association between
   single-use plastic and organic food purchases, underscoring
   environmental concern as one of the motives for choosing organic foods.
   The findings indicate that organic food marketing should emphasize
   environmental benefits to appeal to environmentally conscious consumers.},

Abstract = {This study examines the spillover effect of California's 2016 single-use
   bag ban (SB 270) on unregulated single-use plastics (SUPs) like cutlery,
   cups, and plates. We observed an insignificant 4.8\% decrease in SUP
   sales over the entire post-policy period, but a larger 8.1\% drop in the
   second post-year, which was only marginally significant. The findings
   suggest weak spillover effects from such environmental policies,
   indicating that direct regulations on certain environmentally harmful
   products might be more effective if jurisdictions aim to prohibit
   citizens from excessive use, rather than relying on the positive
   spillover effect from existing policies.},

Abstract = {Three studies examine the effectiveness of social norm messaging in a
   green consumption context. The overall goal is to identify theory-based
   ways to increase consumer choice of biodegradable take-out food
   packaging with an extra charge versus single-use plastic with no charge
   in the US and South Korea. Results indicate that descriptive norm
   messaging is superior to prescriptive norm messaging in both countries.
   Prescriptive norm messaging produced significantly higher reactance and
   more negative attitudes toward the packaging selection experience in the
   US, suggesting serious backfire effects in that country, but not in
   South Korea. Results advance theory regarding the use of social norm
   messaging to increase consumers' willingness to pay an additional charge
   for take-out food packaging that is biodegradable versus single-use
   plastic. Managerial and policy implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastic waste has become a growing concern in daily life.
   Community leaders are implementing programs to reduce the use of
   single-use plastic and change consumer behavior. This study, using the
   social cognitive theory framework for sustainable consumption, examines
   the reciprocal relationship among the following three factors: personal
   (green consumer values), environmental (bans and rebate/reward
   programs), and behavioral (consumer decision-making related to
   single-use plastic waste). The study surveyed consumers (N = 330) across
   the United States who watched a video on the effects of single-use
   plastic waste on health and well-being. The results indicate that states
   with bans or rebate/reward programs tend to have higher green consumer
   values and consumers in those states report less use of single-use
   plastic waste. Education level also has a significant impact on green
   consumer values and plastic waste usage. The study provides a resource
   guide for decision makers to implement programs in five areas: (1)
   Business Resources, (2) Public Policy Resources, (3) Non-Profit
   Resources, (4) Education Resources, and (5) Personal Resources. The
   study also suggests potential areas for future research.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastics (SUPs) are significant contributors to the overall
   generation of plastic and microplastic waste. SUPs are the chief
   materials used for packaging and other such purposes resulting in
   immediate disposal after use. Recognizing the environmental burden posed
   by SUPs in the form of microplastics, many countries have banned these
   materials. However, addressing this issue requires a more diversified
   approach. The present article focuses on recent initiatives adopted by
   India for SUP management. Drawing lessons from the experiences of other
   countries, India has not only imposed ban but adopted an extended
   producer responsibility approach as well for managing the waste
   emanating from SUPs. For this, India took the interventions both at the
   supply side as well as the demand side. Nevertheless, assessment
   methodologies have been developed, including surveillance, grievance
   redressal, digital interventions, periodic monitoring, and auditing.
   While the outcome of this approach will be visible after a few years, an
   initial appraisal is deemed necessary. Therefore, this paper outlines
   India's approach, implementation strategy, assessment methodology,
   possible implications, and future prospects. This multi-faceted nature
   of the approach involves a number of stakeholders in the SUP chain
   making it suitable for adoption by other developing nations as well.
   Effective management of single-use plastic (SUP) waste can significantly
   help to minimize microplastic pollution.},

Abstract = {Governments have been introducing strategies to reduce plastic waste.
   The reduction in plastic waste can be possible through single-use
   plastic avoidance. However, this is only possible with the proper
   understanding of the behavioral factors of single-use plastic avoidance
   behavior (SPAB). This study explores the factors that influence the
   decision-making process regarding SPAB in China, a major environmental
   problem, climate change, and global warming. The authors used a
   questionnaire survey to collect data from 421 respondents and analyze it
   using structural equation modeling (SEM). The study examines the effects
   of attitude, subjective norms (SNs), perceived behavior control (PBC),
   and policy intervention (PI) on single-use plastic avoidance behavior
   (SPAB) mediated by plastic avoidance behavioral intentions (PABI) and
   plastic-related environmental concerns (PREC). The analysis reveals that
   attitude, PBC, and PI significantly affect PABI, which affects SPAB.
   Moreover, PREC influences both PABI and SPAB. Furthermore, PI
   significantly impacts SPAB through PABI and PREC. The study suggests
   that effective PIs are crucial to reducing single-use plastic waste by
   shaping attitude, PBC, PABI, and PREC among the public and promoting
   pro-environmental behavior to achieve the objective of environmental
   sustainability.},

Title = {Reducing single-use plastic in everyday social practices: Insights from
   a living lab experiment},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {200},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Plastic is ubiquitous in everyday social practices, and few consumer
   activities do not involve its direct or indirect use. Single-use plastic
   (SUP) based on fossil fuels is particularly problematic, as it seems
   virtually unavoidable, especially in everyday products, from plastic
   wrapping cucumbers to shampoo bottles. Although reducing SUP is crucial,
   there is little evidence of achieving this in everyday social practices.
   This paper examines the practicality of reducing SUP and consumer
   frustration. We studied the social practices of 20 adults using diary
   records and workshops over the course of two weeks. Our findings suggest
   that everyday practices shape SUP use, and reducing it disrupts daily
   life, even for eco-conscious consumers. Packaging-free shops are a
   popular approach to reducing SUP. However, consumers are hindered from
   using this alternative by limited availability, convenience and product
   variety. Future research should explore the seamless integration of
   alternatives to reduce SUP into everyday social practices.},

Title = {Single-use plastic or paper products? A dilemma that requires societal
   change},
Journal = {CLEANER WASTE SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution has reached irreversible levels in both the
   terrestrial and marine environments affecting our planet's fauna and
   human health. Plastic debris originating from single-use plastic
   products (such as bags, cups, straws, etc.) has been reported in every
   natural habitat around the globe, and their fragmentation to micro and
   nano-plastics poses high risks for every organism, including humans.
   Political pressure and awareness campaigns over the past decades have
   led governments and the industry to adopt legislative measures to ban
   the use of single-use plastics and seek alternative solutions. Hence,
   single-use paper cups, straws, lids, packages, etc. started infiltrating
   our daily routine, as the most promising alternative to plastic
   products. However, there has been increasing research in recent years
   showing that single-use paper products can be harmful to both the
   environment and human health. This work reviewed the ongoing research on
   the hazards associated with the use of single-use plastic and paper
   products to assess whether paper is a viable solution to plastic. The
   findings reported here show that single-use paper products might be
   extremely harmful to both the terrestrial, fresh, and marine
   environment, as well as human health and climate change. This is due to
   the release of toxic chemical compounds directly into the environment
   (as in many cases these products are not recyclable) and the
   food/beverage (due to their rapid mechanical/compositional failure), and
   the release of greenhouse gases, upon degradation. Moreover, this study
   discusses consumer behavior from research performed in several countries
   and discusses that most consumers exhibit environmental consciousness,
   but require better incentives to use multi-use products and turn away
   from single-use products. Overall, the most promising solution to
   mitigate pollution from single-use products is to combine the
   environmental consciousness of consumers with economic measures (taxes,
   levies) for purchasing single-use products to reduce their usage.},

Title = {Breaking the bag habit: Testing interventions to reduce plastic bag
   demand},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {228},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In a natural field experiment conducted in a big grocery chain in
   Armenia, we test the impact of demand-side behavioral (an environmental
   nudge) and conventional (financial bonus scheme) policies to curb the
   purchase of single-use plastic bags. We find that both interventions are
   effective to reduce the demand for single-use plastic bags. Furthermore,
   the financial bonus scheme is more powerful than the environmental
   nudge. However, the financial bonus scheme backfires in the sense that
   it reduces the visits to the grocery chain resulting in less money spent
   by an average customer unlike the environmental nudge. We also study,
   whether customers use the reusable bags received for free and how to
   motivate them to do so. The findings suggest a strong correlation
   between reusable bag usage and shopping frequency. While many customers
   use the bag only once, the more frequent the shopping behavior the
   higher the usage of the reusable bags. Lastly, financial incentives
   matter for reusable bag usage.},

Abstract = {Plastics are ubiquitous in many sectors, including but not limited to
   construction, textiles, electronics, and transportation. The immoderate
   use of single-use plastics has wreaked havoc on society. An ecofriendly
   and sustainable economic system demands proper usage of raw materials
   and substitution of fossil fuel-based resources with renewable
   materials. Of late, bio-based constituents have attracted considerable
   attention from the public in view of ecological safety and economic
   interests. Bio-based sources are cost-effective, reusable, clean and
   reduce the ecological footprint. Biopolymers can be derived from biomass
   (polysaccharides, proteins, lipids), bio-derived substances
   (polylactate) or microorganisms (PHB, PHA, Xanthum gum). The commonly
   used polysaccharides include starch, cellulose, gums and chitosan.
   However, the hydrophilic nature of most of the polysaccharides affects
   the physical and mechanical properties and is not on par with the
   synthetic plastics that are generally used. In order to expand the
   applications of biodegradable polymers in various sectors, it is
   imperative to address the challenges associated with gas permeability,
   processing methods, thermal stability, etc. Various physical and
   chemical modification methods are employed to overcome these
   limitations. Creating awareness among the public and encouraging them to
   use renewable sources is important. There is a strong need to develop
   innovative biodegradable products and promote them by fostering
   collaboration among entrepreneurs. This review paper provides an
   overview of the biodegradable materials that can be produced from
   different sources such as vegetable and fruit waste, cereals and pulses
   waste, seaweeds, animal waste, wood waste and aims to address the
   current limitations and indicate the future directions.},

Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Cambodia is a rapidly developing country in south-east Asia, a region
   forecast as an outsized source of plastic pollution into the world's
   oceans. However, to date there has been no large-scale assessment of
   plastic pollution in the environment within the country. We conducted a
   comprehensive assessment of plastic items and hotspots across 243
   coastal, river and inland sites along the entire coastline of Cambodia,
   recording 46,927 items in transects throughout the study area. Plastic
   densities along coastlines were more than ten times those on riverbanks
   and more than twenty times that of inland areas. Averaging 70 plastic
   items per metre of coastline, Cambodia has among the highest average
   loads of whole plastic items recorded on coastlines globally. Single-use
   plastic bottles were the most abundant whole item recorded,
   overrepresented by drinking water bottles. Polystyrene foam was the most
   common fragmented item. We provide specific recommendations to reduce
   plastic in Cambodia's environment.},

Abstract = {In recent years, a growing body of literature on seafloor macro -litter
   has been produced worldwide. However, the spatial coverage of these
   studies is still limited and highly unbalanced, resulting in
   considerable knowledge gaps in some regions. To address this lack of
   information in Oceania, we extracted data from the Citizen Science
   project Dive Against Debris (R) to characterize marine debris collected
   by volunteer scuba divers on the coastal seafloor. Overall, the average
   litter density was 58.22 items/100m2, with plastics accounting for
   approximately 50 \% of the total abundance and Single Use Plastics
   accounting for nearly 17 \%. Notably, 36 \% of the total litter
   abundance consisted of lost Fishing Gear including fishing lines,
   sinkers, baits and hooks as the most abundant debris items. To reduce
   lost fishing gear, clean-up initiatives by divers along with management
   actions such as education programs for fishermen, gear restrictions and
   the identification of designated fishing sites are recommended.},

Title = {Impact of Policy Design on Plastic Waste Reduction in Africa},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Single-use plastic (SUP) is an important product group in plastic
   pollution with various measures managing it within its lifecycle. Africa
   has the highest single-use plastic bag (SUPB) policy adoption by region
   globally, but the plastic problem persists, raising policy design
   concerns on effectiveness. This paper explores plastic policy design on
   plastic waste reduction in Africa. Using gap analysis and integrative
   propositional analysis, the status, scope, and variability of policies
   are assessed against a reference model. There are 48 active policies in
   39 of the 55 countries in Africa. Of these, three countries have
   transitioned from plastic bag bans to SUP policies to manage more
   plastic products, and two countries have transitioned from SUPB charges
   to SUPB bans. There are 12 packaging policies, 29 bag policies, 2 bottle
   policies, 1 utensil and polystyrene boxes policy, and 1 straw policy.
   Themed SUP and packaging policies loosely cover plastic products. Four
   of the nine packaging policies analyzed are SUPB policies by design, as
   they explicitly mention the control of bags rather than primary
   packaging. Sixteen policies are designed for biodegradability
   restrictions, while ten policies are total bans on single-use plastic
   products. The lack of definitions and coherence and provision of
   exemptions in policies result in plastic waste traceable from
   exemptions, in-policy, undefined SUP, out-of-policy SUP, and non-SUP
   sources. The use of different policy mix instruments to manage plastic
   within its lifecycle was identified in African countries. The design of
   new policies should consider these shortcomings to enhance plastic waste
   management by explicitly identifying products and outlining management
   measures for excluded plastic products within the same plastic group for
   SUP or packaging policies in the absence of a global or regionally
   binding plastic policy.},

Title = {The degradation of single-use plastics and commercially viable
   bioplastics in the environment: A review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Plastics have become an integral part of human life. Single-use plastics
   (SUPs) are disposable plastics designed to be used once then promptly
   discarded or recycled. This SUPs range from packaging and takeaway
   containers to disposable razors and hotel toiletries. Synthetic
   plastics, which are made of non-renewable petroleum and nat-ural gas
   resources, require decades to perpetually disintegrate in nature thus
   contribute to plastic pollution worldwide, especially in marine
   environments. In response to these problems, bioplastics or bio-based
   and biodegradable polymers from renewable sources has been considered as
   an alternative. Understanding the mechanisms behind the degradation of
   conventional SUPs and biodegradability of their greener counterpart,
   bioplastics, is crucial for appropriate material selection in the
   future. This review aims to provide insights into the degradation or
   disintegration of conventional single-use plastics and the
   biodegradability of the different types of greener-counterparts,
   bioplastics, their mechanisms, and conditions. This review highlights on
   the biodegradation in the environments including composting systems.
   Here, the various types of alternative biodegradable polymers, such as
   bacterially biosynthesised bioplastics, natural fibre-reinforced
   plastics, starch-, cellulose-, lignin-, and soy-based polymers were
   explored. Review of past literature revealed that although bioplastics
   are relatively eco-friendly, their natural compositions and properties
   are inconsistent. Furthermore, the global plastic market for
   biodegradable plastics remains relatively small and require further
   research and commercialization efforts, especially considering the
   urgency of plastic and microplastic pollution as currently critical
   global issue. Biodegradable plastics have potential to replace
   conventional plastics as they show biodegradation ability under real
   environments, and thus intensive research on the various biodegradable
   plastics is needed to inform stakeholders and policy makers on the
   appropriate response to the gradually emerging biodegradable plastics.},

Abstract = {The escalating threat of plastic pollution necessitates urgent and
   immediate action, particularly within the food and beverage (F\&B)
   industry, a significant contributor to single-use plastic waste (SUP).
   As the global population surges, so does the consumption of single-use
   plastics in the F\&B sector, perpetuating a linear economy model
   characterized by a `take, make, use, dispose' approach. This model
   significantly exacerbates plastic waste issues, with projections
   indicating an alarming increase in plastic outputs by 2050 if current
   practices continue. Against this backdrop, the circular economy presents
   a viable alternative, with its emphasis on resource retention, recovery,
   and the extension of product lifecycles. This study delves into the
   problems posed by single-use plastics, introduces the circular economy
   as a sustainable model, and explores effective strategies for the
   recycling and reuse of plastic waste within this framework. By examining
   the environmental impact of SUP in the F\&B sector and advocating for
   the adoption of circular economy principles, this paper underscores a
   critical pathway towards sustainable solutions in the battle against
   plastic pollution. In conclusion, the transition to a circular economy,
   underpinned by global collaboration and the proactive implementation of
   supportive policies, is imperative for reducing the environmental
   footprint of single-use plastics and fostering a sustainable future.},

Journal = {REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE CONTAMINACION AMBIENTAL},
Year = {2024},

Pages = {105-117},
Abstract = {In Mexico, there is a growing trend to reform the state waste management
   legislation to curb the dispersion of single -use plastics (P1U) and
   encourage waste reduction through co-responsibility actions. Currently,
   29 of Mexico's 32 states establish the participation of society's
   sectors to motivate plastics governance in their laws. However, a
   national study is still needed to provide information on how
   responsibility is distributed within the legislation. Therefore, through
   network analysis, this study aimed to evaluate the diversity of actors
   and their inclusion as sectors within the legislation regulating P1U in
   Mexico. According to the research findings, Mexican state legislation
   aimed at reducing the spread of P1U relies primarily on economic
   measures targeting the distribution and commercialization sectors,
   accounting for 90\% of the overall strategy.; however, the productive
   and academic sectors are underrepresented. This study presents a
   methodological proposal to provide a concise and schematic visualization
   of the diverse actors and sectors involved in the complex responsibility
   landscape for P1U reduction. The network analysis tool could be used to
   facilitate the task of decision-makers or for research that considers
   quantitative legislative review.},

   among Thai university students},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 9},
Abstract = {This study investigated the decision-making dynamics for
   pro-environmental behavior among Thai university students, focusing on
   reducing the consumption of single-use plastics (SUP). By adopting a
   dynamic approach to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the research
   examined the influence of psychosocial factors, including attitudes,
   perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms, on SUP reduction
   intention at different phases of behavior change. Using structural
   equation modelling, we analyzed quantitative data (n = 317) from the
   selected universities. The results revealed that attitudes predicted
   behavioral intentions only among individuals in the contemplation phase
   of reducing SUP. Attitudes had a small but limited influence on the
   behavioral intentions of students who had not yet acted. Perceived
   behavioral control, on the other hand, significantly impacted behavioral
   intentions across all phases of behavior change, highlighting its
   importance in SUP reduction. The study also confirmed subjective norms'
   positive influence on students' behavioral intentions in the
   pre-contemplation phase. Practical implications suggested segmenting
   residents based on their behavior change phase so that public
   policymakers can allocate resources more efficiently and effectively by
   tailoring campaigns to specific behavior change phases, ultimately
   promoting sustainable behavior among university students.},

Abstract = {Laboratory-based research is resource intensive in terms of financial
   costs and its carbon footprint. Research laboratories require immense
   amounts of energy to power equipment, as well as large volumes of
   materials, particularly of single-use item consumption. In fact, many
   laboratories have essentially become reliant on single-use plastics.
   Understanding the full carbon footprint of consumable usage is
   increasingly important as many research institutes commit to carbon
   neutrality. To date, no carbon footprint assessment has been conducted
   to detail the differences between single-use plastics, and reusable
   glass in a laboratory setting. Here, we analyse the CO2 equivalent
   (CO(2)e) footprint of utilising single-use plastics, and re-use of glass
   or plastic items within laboratory environments. We focused our
   assessment on four commonly utilised consumables for mammalian cell and
   bacterial culture, and found that re-use scenarios resulted in
   substantial reduction in CO(2)e footprint up to 11-fold. In addition, we
   estimated the long-term financial costs of re-use and single-use
   scenarios, and found that re-use had either similar or much lower
   running costs even when including technical staff wage. We concluded
   that research facilities must foster re-use in laboratory consumables,
   while reserving single-use items for select, defined cases. Our study
   highlights the need to account for indirect CO(2)e footprint in
   designing a carbon-neutral lab and promotes circular economy principles.},

   mixed-method study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {414},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {The production and consumption of single-use plastics (SUP) has
   disastrous consequences for the natural environment. Understanding which
   consumers are more likely to avoid SUP and why is crucial. Building on a
   comprehensive action determination model of ecological behavior, this
   study aims to specify the most relevant drivers and barriers to
   consumers' intentions to avoid SUP. The results of a qualitative study
   (N = 32) and a quantitative study (N = 3,000), conducted across multiple
   countries (United States, Russia, and Belgium), reveal that positive
   attitudes and subjective norms regarding SUP alternatives enhance
   consumers' intentions to avoid SUP. Our analysis also shows the
   existence of four consumer segments-SUP addicts, SUP avoiders, the
   apathetic, and situation-driven SUP users-who differ in their intentions
   to avoid SUP and their motivations. While habits in using SUP, and
   situational constraints and hygienic concerns regarding SUP alternatives
   do not play a significant role in the whole cross-national sample, they
   represent crucial barriers for specific segments such as SUP addicts and
   situation-driven SUP users. The study concludes with several marketing
   and design recommendations for promoting and developing reusable
   alternatives for single-use plastics.},

Abstract = {Within the scope of sustainability and sustainable practices
   implementation, the Polytechnic Institute of Viana do Castelo (IPVC) is
   developing a pioneer project for phasing out the consumption of
   single-use plastic water bottles on campus premises and facilities, and
   consequently contribute to the compliance of the United Nations
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Under this scope, this article
   presents the design and implementation of the Refill\_H2O Ecosystem in
   which a reusable water bottle interacts with an intelligent water
   dispensing station, enabled by the introduction of Internet of Things
   (IoT) Technologies on campus, to eliminate the use of single-use plastic
   water bottles in the premises of IPVC, a Portuguese Higher Education
   Institution (HEI), with nearly 6000 students. Three main contributions
   have been identified in this research: (1) by under-taking projects
   designed to foment innovation towards environmental issues, HEIs become
   a sustainability reference model to society as a whole; (2) a pilot that
   takes advantage of IoT technologies for broader interoperability and
   simple integration among the smart bottle (i.e., the interactive
   artifact), and the intelligent water dispensing station; and (3) the
   promotion of environmentally sustainable solutions designed to encourage
   practices that foment innovation, is the key to raise awareness of
   future generations concerning sustainability issues.},

Title = {Journalists in a circular economy: Stakeholders' engagement in the media
   discourse on single-use plastics during the COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {The world faces an alarming plastic waste problem. The volume of plastic
   waste is rapidly and continuously increasing, mainly due to the
   single-use plastics overconsumption, whereas its recycling and
   utilization leave much to be desired. Despite the negative effects of
   plastic on the environment and public health, the COVID-19 outbreak
   shifted the public attention away from the environmental issues,
   potentially giving space for extended lobbyism by interest groups and
   industry to delay or even prevent legislation to combat plastic
   pollution. Our study aims to understand how the media discourse on
   single-use plastic (SUP) in particular, evolves in the course of the
   pandemic. How it vary across EU Member States? For this purpose, we
   specifically analyse plastic-related articles in major prestigious daily
   newspapers published between June 2019 and June 2021 in four EU Member
   States: Germany, France, Italy, and Poland, as countries with different
   levels of sustainable transition to form a representative model of an
   European context. Additionally, between November 2022 and January 2023,
   we conducted a series of interviews via Google Meet, with journalists
   who agreed to be asked on the plastic issues they upraised. Our analysis
   initially covered 1076 articles, out of which 198 articles were rejected
   due to noncompliance with the subject or repetition, leaving 878
   articles forming the database for eventual analysis. Specifically, we
   outline a key impact of the COVID-19 pandemic followed by a clear
   evolution on the number of plastic-related articles, on related
   stakeholder engagement, and the focus on specific SUP items. Moreover,
   we address a research gap- presenting a media portrait of different
   types of SUP in more details and highlighting the significance based on
   several culturally and linguistically very different countries within a
   single supranational state (EU). A clear trend reversal towards an
   informed knowledge circulation across the circular economy model of
   single-use plastics is ultimately essential to develop sustainable
   solutions to reject the disposable culture, stop the waste of natural
   resources, and reduce the consumption of oil or gas for plastic
   production and thus protect the climate.},

Abstract = {Marine debris comprising single-use plastic products (SUPs) is
   ubiquitous in Asian coastal waters, but there is little informa-tion on
   the types of polymers and the concentrations of plastic additives such
   waste products contain. In this study, 413 SUPs randomly collected from
   4 Asian countries between 2020 and 2021 were analyzed to obtain specific
   polymer and organic additive profiles. Polyethylene (PE), coupled with
   external polymers, was prominent in the inside of the SUPs, whereas
   poly-propylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were prevalent
   in both the insides and outsides of the SUPs. The use of different
   polymers in the insides and outsides of PE SUPs implies specific and
   complicated recycling systems are required to maintain the purity of the
   products. Phthalate plasticizers including dimethyl phthalate (DMP),
   diethyl phthalate (DEP), diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), dibutyl phthalate
   (DBP), and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and the antioxidant
   butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) were prevalent in the SUPs (n = 68). High
   concentrations of DEHP were detected in PE bags from Myanmar (820,000
   ng/g) and Indonesia (420,000 ng/g), which were an order of magnitude
   greater than the concentra-tions in PE bags collected in Japan. SUPs
   containing high concentrations of organic additives may be the primary
   source of harmful chemicals in the environment, and should be
   responsible for their ubiquitous distribution in ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The increasing production of plastics, driven by modern societal
   development, has resulted in a significant rise in plastic waste, which
   poses serious environmental concerns due to its lengthy degradation
   times. The growing issue of single-use plastics (SUPs), such as
   packaging for food items and disposable utensils, has led to their
   reduction and potential future prohibition in the European Union.
   Cellulose, a natural biopolymer sourced from nature, has been proposed
   as a viable alternative to SUPs because it degrades without toxicity.
   However, its limited barrier properties against water and grease have
   restricted its effectiveness as a substitute. This study focuses on
   developing an environmentally friendly alternative to SUPs by combining
   cellulose with acetylated starch and incorporating inorganic fillers
   like kaolin and talc. These fillers enhance the material's barrier
   properties and reduce production costs. The results indicate that the
   addition of kaolin significantly lowers moisture absorption and water
   vapor permeability, while a mixture of kaolin and talc provides superior
   grease resistance. Additionally, incorporating D-sorbitol as a
   plasticizer improves the mechanical properties of the coated sheets,
   preventing cracking and enhancing strength. Overall, these coatings
   offer a promising alternative for packaging applications, such as for
   sugar, candies, or chocolate.},

Abstract = {The dawn of mass plastic production in the early 20th century has
   accelerated the penetration of microplastics into the environment,
   making them known to be an insidious threat to diverse ecosystems. The
   current scenario for microplastics is dire, as they pervade living
   organisms and disrupt vital functions while also affecting the
   environment by altering soil quality. They pose an inherent risk to
   human health, making their elimination a multifaceted challenge. Due to
   factors such as small size, low biodegradability, and ubiquity,
   microplastics are particularly challenging to detect, and methods for
   their elimination from terrestrial and marine environments are an
   ever-evolving field of research. The detection of such microplastics has
   necessitated the use of various biotechnological techniques to monitor
   microplastic pollution. The control of microplastic pollution in natural
   ecosystems can be met by replacing mass-produced single-use plastics
   with viable bio-based alternatives. The main objectives of this review
   are to discuss how microplastic pollution is currently monitored,
   assessed, and controlled using satellite-generated imagery complemented
   with a range of biotechnological and bioremedial techniques. This review
   also traces the development of a range of bio-based plastic alternatives
   that are observed to potentially replace single-use plastics. Further
   discussion on the various challenges and prospects for the mitigation of
   microplastics will also be conducted, stressing the importance of future
   research.},

Abstract = {The recalcitrant behaviour of plastic creates an acute pollution on soil
   and aquatic biota. The plastic polymer synthesised from petroleum takes
   several hundred years to degrade. During excavation activities on the
   lands within or at the outskirts of urban limits, single use plastic
   wrappers and bags that were buried long ago, can be found in large
   quantities. Researchers have already identified the potentiality of
   microorganisms to biodegrade the plastic polymers. These microorganisms
   utilise plastic as a sole source of carbon and mineralise them into
   carbon dioxide under optimum environmental conditions. This paper
   provides a brief review on the biodegradation studies carried out by
   various researchers, spectra of microorganisms identified with the
   potential to degrade various polymeric substances, methods of testing
   and evaluations in order to quantify the effectiveness of degradation,
   their shortfalls and risks involved in implementing bioremediation
   technique in the field. A review on other related aspects that are
   deemed to be relevant to this topic are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastic (SUP) bags at supermarkets have detrimentally
   exacerbated the plastic waste and dump in landfills. Reusable shopping
   bags are a feasible solution to alleviate plastic production and
   consumption, particularly in an emerging economy. The study examined the
   intention to use reusable shopping bags instead of SUP bags, driven by
   personal norms and planning behavior. Bayesian Mindsponge framework
   (BMF) analysis was employed on a dataset of 536 Vietnamese consumers.
   The study found that instead of obligation, voluntary contribution to
   reduce plastic bag pollutant is predominant. Findings also indicate that
   enhancing public awareness and knowledge regarding environmental
   protection is significantly important. Some demographic characteristics,
   such as age, education, members in household, and incomes also moderate
   the relationship between driving factors and intentions. Finally, this
   study prescribes some policy implications and practical solutions to
   reduce and gradually restrict SUP in Vietnam.},

Abstract = {The over-utilization of plastic bags has pushed governments to implement
   a mix of policy measures ranging from banning the bags altogether to
   charging a fee for them. However, these policies are often accompanied
   by unintended consequences. Paying for plastic bags, in particular, may
   crowd out the negative emotions tied to their harmful impact on the
   environment, and may be subject to a `rebound effect'. In a randomized
   controlled experiment, I tested four different treatments aimed at
   nudging or encouraging consumers to carry their own bag to the stores.
   Specifically, I tested the effects of changing the framing of the
   question regarding carrier bags at the checkout till in stores using a
   yes/no response format, in which the yes option corresponds to the
   desired behaviour. The treatment with the yes/no framing format was
   found to have as strong and significant an effect as a charge of 5 pence
   per bag on discouraging single-use plastic bag consumption.},

Abstract = {Excessive use of single-use plastic packaging presents an imminent
   threat to the environment. One of the emerging solutions is using edible
   food packaging. However, there is lack of consumer information toward
   edible packaging. This study evaluated consumer attitude, acceptability,
   and purchase intent of three types of edible food packaging: muffin
   liner, cranberry pomace fruit leather wrap, and powdered drink sachet.
   One hundred consumers who frequently consumed muffins, strawberry fruit
   leather, and powdered lemonade were selected from metropolitan area of
   Portland, Oregon to participate in the study. The panelists were
   presented with the edible films and the food products with the edible
   packaging, information card highlighting the environmental-friendly
   edible package, and were prompted with describing the sensory
   attributes, purchase intent, and qualities regarding the edible
   packaging with and without food. Overall, panelists liked the three
   foods with the edible packaging giving overall liking scores of 7.48,
   8.06, and 7.48 for the muffin liners, edible fruit leather wraps, and
   powdered drink sachets, respectively, based on a 9-point hedonic scale
   where 1 = dislike extremely and 9 = like extremely. When asked about
   hypothetical purchase intent, 64\%-68\% of panelists positively reacted
   to purchase intent and would buy all three types of edible packaging
   products. Based on the positive reaction from panelists, edible
   packaging maybe a possible solution to reducing single-use plastic
   packaging in the food industry. This study can be the catalyst for
   further investigation of the efficacy of different applications of
   edible food packaging as well as consumer perceptions of eating their
   packaging.Practical ApplicationEdible food packaging is an emerging
   solution for reducing single-use plastic waste. This study investigated
   consumer attitude, acceptability, and purchase intent of edible food
   packaging for three food packaging applications, including edible muffin
   liner, fruit leather wrap, and powdered drink sachet. This study
   demonstrated that consumers strongly agree that edible packaging would
   serve as an environmentally sustainable solution to single-use plastics,
   and are willing to spend more to purchase these sustainable
   alternatives. This study provides new information toward the future
   development of edible packaging and consumer perceptions of eating their
   packaging.},

Title = {Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices towards Single-Use Plastic Bags in
   the United Arab Emirates},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Due to their widespread misuse and inadequate waste management,
   single-use plastic bags represent the global plastic pollution crisis
   and ecosystem degradation. Comprehensive research on population
   knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding single-use plastic
   bags is lacking in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This study aims to
   fill this gap by assessing the KAP levels among the UAE population and
   determining the relationships between these variables. A five-point
   Likert scale questionnaire from previous studies was used in a
   cross-sectional study, and the questionnaire was distributed via Google
   Forms. The UAE University Research Ethics Committee approved the study
   (ERSC\_2024\_4377). Non-probability sampling and G{*}power statistical
   analysis version 3.1.9.6 determined 385 UAE residents aged 18 years and
   older. The findings were verified through face-to-face interviews and
   Cronbach's alpha tests. KAP variable associations were assessed using
   Chi-square tests, Pearson's correlation coefficients, and a structural
   equation model with SPSS version 29.0. This test was chosen for robust
   categorical and continuous data. The study included 84.7\% female, and
   15.3\% male participants aged 18 to 65 years, primarily aged 18 to 25
   years, with most holding bachelor's degrees (47.6\%), and were students
   (51.4\%), employed (33.1\%), or unemployed (12.2\%). The results
   indicated a favourable inclination towards sustainability, with mean +/-
   standard deviation (SD) for seven knowledge questions (3.89 +/- 0.7),
   seven attitude questions (3.99 +/- 0.7), and five practice questions
   (3.42 +/- 0.8) exceeding the midpoint. The correlation test showed that
   total knowledge was positively correlated with practice (r = 0.399; p <
   0.001) indicating the increasing knowledge regarding single-use plastic
   bags associated with increasing sustainable practices and attitudes (r =
   0.648; p < 0.001). There was also a significant correlation between the
   total attitude and practice (r = 0.487; p < 0.001). The findings suggest
   targeted educational and policy interventions to promote sustainable
   behaviour.},

Title = {Achieving sustainable source reduction of marine litter for ocean
   conservation in West Africa: Insights from single-use plastic consumers
   in Liberia},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {159},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Source reduction of marine litter is the most preferred approach to
   addressing the global problem of the entry of plastics into the
   environment, including the ocean. Policies to achieve this reduction
   within the African region have so far had limited success. Studying the
   behavioural dimension of the use of single-use plastics (SuPs) may
   provide the knowledge basis for developing sustainable plastic policies
   for desired impact. This study sought to determine the influence of
   socio-demographic factors and awareness of environmental impacts of
   plastics on the use of SuPs in West Africa using Liberia as a case
   study. The SuPs studied include carrier bags, drinking water sachets and
   bottles, drink/beverage bottles and expanded polystyrene packs. The
   results show that different prevailing socio-demographic factors
   influence the different uses of SuPs. Level of education and income
   levels of the respondents, for instance, had significantly positive
   influence on the patronage of bottled water, bottled drinks and expanded
   polystyrene packs. While on the other hand, rising income level had a
   significant negative influence on the use of sachet water alone. It also
   showed that awareness of environmental impacts of SuPs had no
   significant influence on the use of plastic carrier bags and sachet
   water but rather increased significantly the use of all other SuPs. The
   observed patterns of use of the SuPs imply underlying factors that need
   to be thoughtfully considered in developing SuP reduction policies and
   SuP management infrastructure as matters of priority. The study
   recommends that similar studies should be conducted in other parts of
   Liberia as well as across Africa to provide a basis for the development
   of effective behaviour intervention programmes. This study also provides
   a scientific context to apply recommendations of this study to other
   West African countries with similar issues and challenges with marine
   litter menace.},

Title = {Why Nigeria should ban single-use plastics: Excessive microplastic
   pollution of the water, sediments and fish species in Osun River,

Abstract = {The Osun River serves as a source of drinking and domestic water for
   some communities in Osun State Nigeria, in addition to providing a
   source of ``healing water{''} for the worshippers of the Osun goddess.
   The sacred river has earned the status of a UNESCO world heritage centre
   for the worldwide attention it receives, as a result of the yearly
   Osun-Oshogbo worship festival. In this study, an initial investigation
   of microplastic pollution of the river water, sediments and fish species
   was conducted. Abundance of microplastics in the river water samples, at
   a maximum of 22,079 +/- 134 particles/litre, represents the highest
   reported so far for a river water globally. FTIR analyses revealed seven
   polymer materials, including acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and
   ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), that have not been commonly reported for
   river environments. Microplastics ranged from 407 +/- 244 to 1691.7 +/-
   443 particles in the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) of six fish species
   analysed, with silver catfish (Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus) having the
   highest concentration. Levels in the fishes are higher than those
   reported for fishes in Asia and Europe, but similar to some other
   plastic pollution hotspots in Africa. This study recognizes the
   uncontrolled and indiscriminate disposal of single-use plastics as a key
   factor in the level of microplastic pollution of the Osun river. We
   emphasize the need by Nigerian government to ban certain single-use
   plastics, as a step towards reducing plastic pollution of Nigerian
   rivers, that shelter important fish species and provide water for
   religious and domestic purposes.},

Abstract = {There has been an exponential growth in supermarket e-commerce services
   in recent years. Delivery services, due to their peculiarities and
   requirements, are causing a significant increase in single-use plastics.
   Given the pollution caused by excessive plastic waste, solutions must be
   created to minimize the consumption of single-use plastics.
   The main goal of this case study is to propose a new stage in the
   supermarket e-commerce services, replacing single-use plastic used for
   transporting orders with reusable products with high longevity.
   Mixed methods were applied for this research including analysis of
   packaging methods in Portuguese supermarkets, analysis of effective
   delivery solutions from supermarkets worldwide as well as participant
   observation of the picking process in one of the Continente warehouses.
   Intrinsic problems were identified that compromise the service
   effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability.
   A set of components was designed to adapt to the equipment used by
   Continente and other national and international supermarkets and stores.
   This set is capable of reconciling, organizing, and protecting the
   ordered products, eliminating the need for plastic transport bags and
   other single-use elements used for preservation purposes. The
   conjunction of designers, engineers, and specialists in the elastomers
   and thermoplastics industry, as well as the support from experienced
   operations employees of the e-commerce service, make this proposal
   evidence of an adequate solution, capable of being mass-produced at low
   costs, providing significant improvements to the service.},

Title = {The ivory tower of academia in the era of climate change: European
   scientists' engagement in science popularization related to single-use
   plastics},

Abstract = {Single-use plastics (SUPs) pose a major threat to the environment and
   public health due to their persistent popularity, exponential growth,
   and skeptical predictions regarding disposal methods. However, despite
   the declared importance of this topic in the scientific community,
   related science popularization efforts remain superficial. Here, we
   present a novel approach integrating the circular economy (CE) with the
   quintuple helix model to reveal interlinkages between academics, CE
   stakeholders and the public to assess how scientists face their
   responsibility for knowledge brokerage and popularization. SUP related
   researchers from four EU countries (Germany, France, Italy, and Poland)
   participated in a survey, followed by a complementary focus group. Most
   respondents considered science popularization as very or extremely
   important, and primarily to be carried out by scientists and
   journalists. The most popular channels were workshops, press, social
   media, while target audiences included mainly consumers, policy makers
   and local authorities. Despite the acknowledgment of the scientific
   mission (social impact, care for nature), popularization activities are
   discouraged by lack of time and improper research evaluation. Consumers'
   decisions are closely linked to environmental awareness which cannot be
   raised based on often false, easily accessible viral news. Involving the
   latter in science popularization requires systemic changes that, on the
   one hand, encourage researchers to leave their ivory towers (e.g., by
   including popularization achievements into research evaluation) and, on
   the other hand, provide them with relevant skills. This will hopefully
   increase trust in science among the public, and ultimately lead to a
   more rational use of plastics..},

Abstract = {Plastic and microplastic contamination continue to be growing problems
   across the globe for both ecosystems and human health. Canada has banned
   single-use plastic products such as bags, cutlery, and foodservice ware
   (containers) to address and mitigate plastics and microplastic
   contamination. This study evaluates the life cycle of banned plastic
   products and their alternatives to determine whether environmental
   impacts can be mitigated. The environmental impacts of bags (plastic,
   paper, cotton), cutlery (plastic, wooden, biodegradable), and containers
   (plastic, styrofoam, biodegradable) were determined considering both
   domestic and imported products. The bag study saw paper bags having the
   highest environmental impacts and cotton bags with the lowest due to
   their reusability. For the cutlery study, plastic cutlery was the most
   impactful across all categories except for eutrophication and ozone
   depletion, where biodegradable cutlery was the most impactful by 25\%
   and 35\%, respectively. In the case of foodservice ware (containers),
   styrofoam was found to be the least impactful. Similar to cutlery, the
   plastic containers had the greatest impact except where the
   biodegradable container contributed more to ozone depletion and
   eutrophication by 25\% and 45\%, respectively. Local production reduced
   impacts across all categories. Furthermore, on a local scale,
   biodegradable cutlery had a greater impact on the smog and respiratory
   effects categories than plastic by 10\% and 30\%, respectively. The
   results of this study indicate that future regulations should focus on
   promoting and educating consumers on the use of reusable products over
   single-use products, funding research to mitigate challenges associated
   with waste management, and consider an informed ban on all single-use
   products and not just those made of plastic material to mitigate
   environmental impacts.},

Abstract = {The study investigates residents' behavior towards reducing the use of
   single-use plastic (SUP), specifically in the context of food packaging.
   The widespread view holds that pro-environmental behavior (PB) results
   from a person's moral and rational deliberations. In reducing single-use
   plastic (SUP) consumption and waste, the relative roles of rationality
   and morality models in validating PB among rural and urban residents are
   not yet clear. In this empirical study, we compared the relative
   efficacy of two models for explaining people's SUP reduction behavior:
   the theory of planned behavior (TPB; rationality) and the value belief
   norm (VBN; morality). We investigated Thailand's rural (Sichang Island)
   and metropolitan (Nonthaburi city) areas. As a result, we surveyed
   people living on Sichang Island (n=255) and in Nonthaburi city (n=310).
   We employed structural equation modeling (SEM) for data analysis in this
   study. Findings showed that while morality better justified all the
   study participants' SUP reduction behavior, rationality underpinned
   behaviors of rural residents, while morality better explained the
   actions of city residents. We discussed future theoretical development
   and a policy roadmap based on these findings.},

Title = {Goodbye Plastic Bags? Lessons from the Shopping Plastic Bag Ban in Chile},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Bans on single-use plastic shopping bags (SUPBs) are a popular policy to
   tackle plastic pollution. However, their success has been evaluated
   solely based on reduced SUPBs consumption, ignoring the impacts of
   substitutes. This article addresses this gap by analyzing the Chilean
   plastic bag ban law. Results show a reduction of similar to 249 kilotons
   of SUPBs consumed and a change in the materiality of shopping bags
   (mainly toward paper), but also an increase of more than 50\% of bin
   liners after the enactment of the ban. Despite some undesired effects,
   an improvement in the environmental performance of the bag market is
   obtained in fifteen of the eighteen categories studied. The
   environmental impacts are on average 38\% lower than in the
   counterfactual scenario. This suggests that the law is being effective
   in protecting the environment. The strictness of the ban and its rapid
   enforcement were positive aspects of its design, but ignoring the
   end-of-life of the bags could be limiting its impact. To reduce the
   environmental impact of substitutes, it is recommended to create design
   guidelines for shopping bags and bin liners.},

Abstract = {Modern society depends on plastic, especially through single-use plastic
   products (SUPs), which can affect ecological systems after use. Local
   policymakers can strategically adopt measures against SUPs pollution by
   setting effective local governance. This work was designed to evaluate
   SUPs consumption inside the Marine Protected Area of the Egadi Islands.
   A questionnaire mixed approach to understanding stakeholders'
   consumption, attitudes and perceptions about the uses and impacts of
   SUPs in the third sector was used. Results show a significant seasonal
   consumption of SUPs and uncertainty in the behaviour to discard them.
   These provide valuable insights to fill research gaps in estimating the
   use of SUPs and consumers' perceptions. The main aim of this work has
   been to understand the critical issues regarding the use of SUPs,
   considering the target area's patterns, in support of designing action
   plans for changing behaviour and the mitigation of critical issues in
   favour of environmental conservation.},

Title = {Reusable glassware for routine cell culture-a sterile, sustainable and

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Cell culture is a cornerstone of in vitro biological research. Whilst
   glassware was once commonplace in tissue culture facilities, in recent
   decades laboratories have moved towards a heavy reliance on single use
   plastics for routine procedures. Single use plastics allow for
   accessible, sterile, and often affordable equipment that comes at a high
   environmental cost. We developed a glassware preparation and cleaning
   process that allowed the comparison of ``traditional{''} plastic-heavy,
   and adapted ``sustainable,{''} cell culture practices, to empirically
   compare the sterility, viability, and proliferative capacity of cells
   cultured with differing techniques, by observing IL-6 production,
   morphology, and proliferation rate of cultured human pulmonary
   fibroblast cells. During which, we calculated the carbon footprint of
   traditional versus sustainable methods. We additionally endeavored to
   provide a realistic overview of the steps required to transition to more
   sustainable cell culture practices and make suggestions to ease the
   cost, labor, and time required to uptake similar practices in other
   laboratories. Cells cultured using reusable glassware did not show signs
   of contamination or stress compared to cells grown solely with
   plasticware, and glassware baked at 180 degrees C for 120 min was
   sufficiently decontaminated and depyrogenated for culturing these cells.
   An individual researcher adopting the same methodology could reduce
   their carbon footprint by 105.92 kg of Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e)
   whilst also saving money (408.78) pound over a 10-year period. We
   predict that these benefits would be greater if more researchers were to
   uptake these adapted practices. We intend for this paper to reassure
   researchers that viable, sterile, and sustainable routine cell culture
   can be achieved with little upfront cost to the researcher, with the
   prospective benefit of greatly reducing the cost to the environment. We
   additionally hope that increased uptake, and thus demand of more
   sustainable practices, encourages suppliers, policy makers, and funding
   bodies to make sustainable practices more accessible to individual
   researchers and institutions worldwide.},

Title = {Reducing single-use plastic on college campuses: Theory of planned
   behavior-based brief interventions},
Journal = {CURRENT RESEARCH IN ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {Single-use plastic has devastating impacts on the natural environment
   and scalable theory-based interventions are urgently needed to curb
   plastic consumption. The purpose of this study is to test the impact of
   two brief plastic reduction interventions on consumption on college
   campuses and whether these effects will be mediated by changes in the
   extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) model consisting of attitudes,
   subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, moral norms, descriptive
   norms, and self-identity. 375 undergraduate students (77\% female) from
   two colleges in the southeastern US completed baseline measures of
   plastic consumption beliefs and behavior in line with the extended TPB
   model. Participants were then randomized into one of three groups-
   control group ( n = 152), app intervention group (who tracked plastic
   behavior on a mobile phone app for a week and received TPB-based daily
   messages via push notifications; n = 89), or pledge intervention group
   (who made a pledge to reduce plastic for a week and received TPB-based
   daily messages via email; n = 134). All participants completed the
   survey again after the intervention week. Results showed that the
   extended TPB model along with the intervention condition significantly
   predicted changes in plastic behavior over the week, R 2 = 0.24, p <
   .001). Additionally, mediation analysis revealed that the pledge group
   (compared to the control group) reported a significant decrease in
   plastic consumption over the week-long intervention, with indirect
   effects via changes in attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and
   descriptive norms. The app group (compared to the control group)
   decreased plastic consumption less and showed no change to the extended
   TPB constructs. Results suggest that plastic reduction interventions
   that influence the extended TPB constructs can be expected to have
   corresponding changes in plastic consumption behavior.},

Abstract = {Microplastic residue left in the environment from plastic chewcards in
   three pest mammal monitoring operations was estimated at an average of
   15\% of the starting weight. This finding highlight the issue of
   single-use plastics within New Zealand's (NZ) conservation sector. A
   review of other research operations across NZ shows a significant number
   of plastic chewcards are deployed, potentially contributing to
   microplastic pollution in environmentally sensitive areas. Our research
   shows the need for sustainable alternatives to plastic chewcards in
   order to mitigate the environmental impact. Alongside an estimation of
   microplastic being left in the environment, we evaluated wood-pulp
   chewcards as a potential alternative to corflute chewcards, with results
   indicating wood-pulp cards maintain comparable interaction rates across
   key pest species. By identifying the environmental issues of
   microplastics in the environment and offering a potential alternative,
   we aim to open a dialogue about adopting more sustainable tools and
   practices in the NZ conservation sector.},

Title = {Engaging faith-based communities in pro-environmental behavior using
   soft regulations: The case of single-use plastics},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JAN 4},
Abstract = {The consumption of single-use plastics, such as disposable tableware
   (DTW), conveys a high benefit-cost ratio for consumers while having
   large environmental externalities. To encourage consumers to reduce
   their use of DTWs, governments could use small and non-coercive changes
   in people's decision-making environments (nudges). This study focuses on
   the Israeli ultra-Orthodox communities a secluded population group that
   grows much faster- and consumes much more DTW than the rest of the
   Israeli population. Employing a quasi-representative sample (N = 450) of
   this population, this study conducted a discrete-choice experiment that
   presents the respondent with alternative options to reduce DTW. Two
   kinds of Nudges-framing and social norms-were utilized. The
   effectiveness of these Nudges in promoting PEB among faith-based
   communities has received little attention in previous studies. As
   another contribution to the literature, this paper also integrates
   latent constructs such as the respondents' environmental attitudes and
   level of conservativeness. 46\% of the respondents chose to opt-out
   whereas 29\%, 14\%, and 11\% chose `1-day', `2-days', and `3-days' per
   week avoiding DTW, respectively. Social norms, framings, and
   environmental attitudes had a significant mediating effect, with framing
   being associated with the highest effect on intentions to reduce DTW,
   i.e., a willingness to give up 0.31 USD per family member per month,
   compared to 0.07 USD for an increase in the description of the social
   norm. The results suggest that Nudges can enhance policies aimed at
   encouraging pro-environmental behavior among faith-based communities.},

Title = {Optimal inspection (monitoring) and penalty (fine) for plastic bag ban
   compliance in Nepal},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {53},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Several cities in the Global South have implemented a (single-use)
   plastic bag ban to curb the use of plastic bags. However, these bans are
   not adequately enforced. Efficient enforcement of the plastic bag ban
   requires a careful calculation of monitoring and fines for violation of
   the ban. This paper calculates optimal fines and monitoring for
   effective enforcement of the plastic bag ban in Nepal. We find at a fine
   set at NRs 764 per episode of violation, nine out of ten retailers are
   likely to comply with the ban with the probability of being caught is
   82.41\%. For consumers, a fine of NRs 222 per episode of violation will
   ensure eight out of ten comply with the ban with a 74\% probability of
   being caught. Although consumers respond to fines, one in ten still uses
   single-use plastic bags despite the enforcement measures. More than 90\%
   of retailers comply ban with sufficiently high fines and intense
   monitoring. Our results highlight municipality can effectively enforce a
   ban with by a careful combination of fines and monitoring.},

Title = {Physio-chemical degradation of single-use plastics in natural weather
   and marine environments},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {357},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution has reached concerning levels globally, with
   single-use plastic products (SUPs) comprising at least 50\% of plastic
   waste. This study investigates the physical and chemical degradation of
   frequently used SUPs, including petroleum-based and bio-based plastics,
   in natural Northern European coastal weather and marine environments
   over a three-year period from 2019 to 2022. Addressing a critical
   knowledge gap, this research was based on a hypothesis that real-world
   ageing studies on SUPs would produce more accurate time- and
   process-lines for their transformation from macro-to microplastics than
   are available today based on the modeling studies more frequently used.
   The study employs optical examination, mechanical testing, Fourier
   Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and Gas Chromatography-Mass
   Spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine and relate physical and chemical
   changes with time. The results indicate that SUPs undergo significantly
   faster degradation in natural weather than predicted to date.
   Photooxidation emerges as the primary degradation pathway for all SUPs,
   emphasizing the role of light in plastic breakdown. Importantly,
   physical degradation to microplastics in natural environments is not
   always associated with significant chemical changes such as breaking
   chemical bonds. Black SUPs exhibit greater resistance to visible light
   and ultraviolet radiation than equivalent white and transparent
   examples. In marine environments, SUPs degrade measurably slower than in
   air, their degradation slowing with increasing distance from the water
   surface. Our findings indicate the urgent need for strategies that
   mitigate the impacts of photo-oxidation of SUPs. Such strategies may
   include a focus on the removal of post-use SUPs from pavements, roads,
   beaches, and water surfaces where photo-oxidation is faster than
   underwater and underground. Preferential use of black SUPs over white or
   transparent should also be considered.},

Title = {Stopping marine debris at the source: Effectiveness of Source Reduction
   Plans in Australia},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {155},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Globally, single-use plastics (i.e., items only used once before being
   discarded plastic, such as straws, plastic bags, cigarette butts) are a
   substantial contributor of debris in the environment. In response,
   policy interventions to minimise single-use plastics and packaging have
   increased in the past decade (e.g., national and state level bans on
   plastic bags). Reduction strategies that tackle debris items at the
   source (i.e., Source Reduction Plans (SRPs)) have been suggested as a
   key strategy to achieve a reduction in debris in the environment. SRPs
   differ in their implementation approach, since different items require
   different methods depending on their characteristics, pathway, and
   source. In Australia, several SRPs have been applied by communities and
   the Tangaroa Blue Foundation (TBF). Globally, there is a lack of
   information available concerning the challenges associated with the
   implementation of SRPs, such as policy considerations and costs.
   Therefore, there is a need to measuring the effectiveness of specific
   SRPs as mitigation tools, to identify their strengths and weaknesses,
   and determine the best reduction approaches for specific items. We
   measured the effectiveness of two quantifiable SRP projects at different
   scales: cigarette butts (consumer level) and strapping bands used in
   fisheries (industrial level). There was a marginally significant decline
   in strapping bands in the environment over time (2004-2020), although we
   were unable to associate this directly to the SRP intervention (ban on
   ships). At a consumer level, there was a decline in the rate of
   cigarette butts flicked on the ground during sporting events post-SRP,
   with an overall reduction of 45.4\% in number of cigarettes per
   spectator. Our results suggest the outcomes differ depending on the type
   of SRP, due to the different characteristics of the tackled item (i.e.,
   source, pathway) and the respective SRP implementation mechanism. We
   highlight the importance of SRPs and make recommendations on future
   steps towards reducing single-use plastics in the environment.},

Abstract = {The earth's climate is encountering positive ecological benefits of the
   pandemic as clean seashores, improved air quality and decreased
   environmental noise have been witnessed. On other hand increase in
   single-use plastics today may leave the drawn-out effect on our
   biological system. This article covers how COVID-19 pandemic is
   indirectly affecting the earth. The virus has brought plastic into our
   lives like never before in form of masks, gloves, personal protective
   equipment (PPE) coveralls and body bags which is without a doubt leading
   to increase in plastic pollution and hence triggering health concerns.
   The plastic boycott in India has been generously postponed because of
   current needs. Every day the whole world is battling against
   coronavirus. It is at the same time seething the plastic waste issue
   which unfortunately cannot be fixed by vaccines and lockdowns.},

Abstract = {Cigarette filters offer no public health benefits, are single-use
   plastics (cellulose acetate) and are routinely littered. Filters account
   for a significant proportion of plastic litter worldwide, requiring
   considerable public funds to remove, and are a source of microplastics.
   Used cigarette filters can leech toxic chemicals and pose an ecological
   risk to both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Bottom-up measures,
   such as focusing on consumer behaviour, are ineffective and we need to
   impose top-down solutions (i.e., bans) if we are to reduce the
   prevalence of this number one litter item. Banning filters offers
   numerous ecological, socioeconomic, and public health benefits.},

   Fans: Applying the Extended Theory of Planned Behavior Model for
   Sustainable Spectating},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {(1) Background: This study explores the intricate relationship between
   sports and the environment, underscoring the influence of individual
   awareness of climate change consequences on fostering eco-friendly
   behavior among sports spectators. (2) Methods: The research introduces
   an extended theory of planned behavior model, incorporating climate
   change awareness. Analyzing data from 431 participants at US
   professional sports events, the study measured variables like climate
   change awareness and theory of planned behavior constructs. (3) Results:
   Sequential multiple mediation analysis validated the model, revealing
   that climate change awareness positively predicts the intention to
   reduce single-use plastics in the context of sport spectatorship. This
   relationship was partially mediated by theory of planned behavior
   variables, with subjective norms identified as a crucial explanatory
   factor. (4) Conclusions: The study's originality lies in shedding light
   on pro-environmental intentions within sports spectatorship. Its
   insights provide foundational knowledge for researchers and
   organizations aiming to devise sustainability strategies in the realm of
   sports.},

Abstract = {This study evaluated the distribution and abundance of marine litter on
   30 beaches around Okinawa Island, Japan. Beach quality indices and
   multivariate statistical analyses were used to assess the quality of the
   beaches and their pollution patterns. A total of 11,626 items weighing
   513.49 kg with an average density of 0.13 +/- 0.10 items/m2 were
   collected. Litter was dominated by plastics (81.72 \%), broken glass
   (8.38 \%), and cigarette butts (7.44 \%), and 74.05 \% of total litter
   was from land-based sources. Single -use plastics (SUPs) were present in
   all surveyed beaches and made up 30.54 \% of the total litter. The clean
   coast index (CCI), plastic abundance index (PAI), and hazardous index
   (HI) were between 0.1 and 7.6, 0.1-4.0 and 0.01-1.42, respectively,
   indicating low to moderate levels of pollution of Okinawan beaches. This
   study should aid in the formation of strategies to deal with marine
   litter in Okinawa, other areas of Japan and the Asia-Pacific region.},

Abstract = {Plastic pollution is a global problem and many countries are
   strengthening their regulations to mitigate the related environmental
   degradation and health risks and to support the development and
   deployment of circular economy for various types of plastics. As Canada
   also develops its strategy for regulating single-use plastic as one
   element of the plastic pollution, aligned federal and provincial
   policies are essential. This study presents an analysis of existing and
   emerging policies to provide guidance on Canada's future regulations.
   Qualitative and quantitative data regarding plastic regulations were
   gathered from similar countries including Australia, the United Kingdom,
   the European Union, the United States and relevant scientific articles.
   Analysis was also conducted of current Canadian regulations that both
   impact and guide the path for plastic regulation, international examples
   provided guidance for future Canadian regulations. The analysis found
   that there is a need for public education on the gravity of plastic
   pollution to gain their support; for establishing pioneering provinces
   or cities in plastic regulations to learn from and provide other cities
   with support; and to start with banning items with available
   alternatives, to be followed by phasing out other items that are more
   difficult to replace. The study also showed potential areas of
   improvement in impact data. The need for reliable regulatory performance
   data against a baseline scenario; consistency in methodology; and proper
   scoping to reduce the risk of displacement or exclusivity in policy were
   identified.},

Abstract = {Reflexive environmental law (REL) techniques create potential for
   reflexivity by regulated companies. This reflexivity is fundamental to
   overcoming various regulatory hurdles posed by complex and dynamic
   sustainability challenges, such as plastics circularity. However, even
   when European Union (EU) environmental legislation incorporates REL
   techniques, Member State transposition may either undermine or enhance
   these techniques' potential for driving regulatee reflexivity. This
   article examines REL's evolution within complex, transnational
   legislative frameworks, taking the EU's Single-use Plastics Directive
   (SUPD) as a case study. It compares reflexivity techniques in the SUPD
   to those in transpositions by France and Germany. Our analysis is based
   on the coding of 11 REL techniques and three overarching reflexive
   drivers-autonomy, accountability and adjustability-within four SUPD
   instruments. Identifying divergence in REL between the SUPD and Member
   State transpositions allows us to highlight three explanations as to why
   REL evolves in certain ways through the transposition process.},

Title = {Protecting public health and the environment: towards a general ban on
   cellulose acetate cigarette filters in the European Union},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {OCT 31},
Abstract = {After the establishment of a causal relationship between tobacco use and
   cancer in the 1950s, cellulose acetate filters were introduced with the
   claim to reduce the adverse health impact of unfiltered cigarettes.
   Often perceived to be more pleasant and healthy, filters encouraged
   smoking. However, filtered cigarettes are more deeply inhaled to obtain
   the same nicotine demand while altered combustion releases more
   tobacco-specific nitrosamines. The increasing use of cigarette filter
   ventilation is associated with a sharp rise in lung adenocarcinomas in
   recent decades. While not preventing adverse health effects, a global
   environmental problem has been created due to the non-biodegradable
   filter litter, causing ecotoxicological effects and the spread of
   microplastics. Recently, the Belgian Superior Health Council advised
   policymakers to ban cigarette filters as single-use plastics at both
   national and European levels. This article outlines the arguments used
   to justify this plea (human health and environment), the expected
   effects of a filter ban, as well as the public reception and reactions
   of the tobacco industry. The specific context of the European Union is
   discussed including the revision of the Single-Use Plastics Directive,
   affording a new opportunity to ban plastic filters. This perspective
   article aims to fuel the momentum and cooperation among member states
   for this purpose.},

Abstract = {With the fast growth of the takeaway sector, waste originating from the
   consumption of single-use plastic food containers (SUPFC) is
   increasingly generated and exacerbates plastic pollution. Its
   substitutes (SUPS), a reliable option for mitigating plastic pollution,
   are attracting attention from both the public and private sectors. To
   better understand consumer preferences in reducing plastic pollution
   from SUPFC, we here establish an intricate fabric of the consumers'
   cognitive impetus toward SUPS and explore the prospects of combining and
   enhancing the technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior
   framework with additional constructs. We simultaneously analyze
   variations in Beijing consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for SUPS via
   the contingent valuation method. The intention to use (ITU) was found to
   be positively influenced by the perceived ease-of-use (PEU), attitude
   (AT), and subjective norms (SN). Conversely, perceived risk exhibited a
   negative correlation with AT, PEU, and ITU. The results further showed
   that ITU was positively correlated with income, age, and education. In
   addition, 95.86 \% of the respondents were willing to pay for SUPS,
   mostly between 3 and 5 RMB (51.18 \%). This study delineates a paradigm
   for elucidating the preference of using SUPS in the context of
   environmental sustainability and pro-environmental consumption. Such
   elucidation holds paramount importance in bolstering forthcoming
   investigations into SUPS utilization and behavioral patterns.},

Abstract = {Many single-use plastic (SUP) options made of synthetic polymers,
   bio-based materials, and blends of both are available in the market and
   used in large quantities. The disintegration of eleven commercial SUP,
   marketed in Mexico as cups and plates, was investigated in an aerobic
   home compost environment at a laboratory scale over 180 days. An
   evaluation of chemical changes, surface morphology, and thermal and
   mechanical properties was conducted to ascertain the original
   composition of SUP and the progression of disintegration in samples that
   are challenging to clean from soil contamination. Furthermore, the
   impact of residual compost on barley (Hordeum vulgare) plant growth and
   its correlation with the leaching of heavy metals were explored. The
   bio-based SUP, but not those made of expanded polystyrene foam, showed a
   correlation between the disintegration degree (measured by weight loss
   into particles <2 mm) and a decrease in functional groups (observed by
   FT-IR), mechanical-thermal stability loss, and surface wear over
   disintegration time. For instance, the highest disintegration at 180
   days was approximately 70 \% for wheat bran and palm leaf plates,
   followed by wheat plates and cellulose-PLA cups (60 \%). In addition to
   the components listed by the manufacturers, the FT-IR and DSC analysis
   revealed the presence of polyethylene and polypropylene in cellulose
   cups and sugarcane plates. These components, impede disintegration but
   contribute to preserving thermal resistance and hydrophobicity during
   utilization. Compost derived from expanded polystyrene foam SUP, with 90
   days of disintegration, was rich in zinc and chromium and significantly
   decrease in the root length of the barley plant compared to the control.
   This demonstrates the necessity of considering the impact of the
   leaching of additives and secondary microplastics into the environment.},

Title = {Transformation of Single-Use Plastics into Lighter Hydrocarbons via an

Abstract = {A mixture of zeolite X and A, derived from coal fly ash (CFA), was
   protonated and utilized as an acid catalyst to decompose single-use
   plastics (SUP) waste into lighter hydrocarbons. Low-density polyethylene
   (LDPE) was selected as the source of SUP, and this study aimed to
   investigate the catalytic effects of the protonated CFA-derived zeolite
   (H-XA) as an economical option on the LDPE pyrolysis temperature and
   output. CFA converted into H-XA through the conventional alkali fusion,
   followed by sonication and simplified hydrothermal and protonation
   processes. The impact of the alkali agent ratio on the resulting product
   was investigated, and outcomes were evaluated. The product with optimum
   properties was then selected for investigation in the LDPE pyrolysis
   studies. Finally, the results were compared with commercial Protonated
   Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (H-ZSM5) and thermal decomposition without
   catalysts. Regarding LDPE degradation temperature, H-XA could lower that
   by 97 degrees C compared to thermal degradation, which was almost the
   same as commercial H-ZSM5 with 110 degrees C. The pyrograms obtained
   through the Pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GCMS)
   analysis indicated the elimination of heavier hydrocarbons in the
   presence of H-XA and the product spectra laid in the range of C3 to C9,
   which was entirely different from the LDPE with hydrocarbons of varying
   lengths. Moreover, kinetic studies on the LDPE decomposition reactions
   in this work have revealed that LDPE conversion occurs at a lower
   activation energy level in the presence of H-XA, which is comparable to
   the energy level observed when H-ZSM5 is used as the catalyst. The
   synthesis of H-XA with desirable catalytic activity, such as the ability
   to lower the LDPE degradation temperature and make lighter hydrocarbons
   as the pyrolysis output, suggests the great potential of the CFA-based
   acid catalyst for use in SUP recycling. This represent a game of waste
   versus waste within the framework of the circular economy, where the
   environment is the ultimate winner.

Abstract = {The excessive use of plastics in recent years, especially so-called
   single-use plastics, has led to an incipient increase in the presence of
   this material in the soil. As soil is the essential production factor in
   agriculture, this study aims to test the toxicity to earthworms of
   different concentrations of plastics using the same substrate for each
   sample. Earthworms are the main bioindicator of soil quality and are of
   particular ecological value because their disappearance or loss in
   population would have disastrous consequences for the environment. This
   study examines the growth, mortality and reproductive cycle of
   individual earthworms. The species to be studied is Eisenia fetida and
   during the test, individuals are immersed in five different
   concentrations: 1 mg/kg; 10 mg/kg; 100 mg/kg; 1000 mg/kg; and 2000
   mg/kg. Bioplastic OK industrial compost (that meet the requirements
   established to comply with compostability according to EN 13432) was
   used. Whether the plastic in any of those concentrations is harmful to
   the worm population was then be checked. The test shows the mixture of
   PLA and PBAT (biodegradable plastic) studied has no significant effect
   on the population of Eisenia fetida. None of the variables studied
   yields significant data on this plastic and the effect it causes on the
   population of earthworms, Eisenia fetida.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastic (SUP) waste is one of the world's major problems,
   particularly if it continues to escape into the ocean unchecked; it will
   become the leading contributor to ocean pollution. Preventing plastic
   waste at its source has proven to be the most effective solution to the
   problem. This study explores a variety of factors that may contribute to
   SUP consumption and reduction behaviour in a convenient sample of
   residents living in Hoi An, a tourist coastal city in Vietnam. Using a
   cross-sectional design, the study reached 150 Vietnamese respondents
   between June and September 2022. The results revealed that subjective
   knowledge about plastics and plastic wastes (b = 0.391) and perceived
   strictness of legal consequences of inappropriate plastic disposal (b =
   -0.642) were two significant predictors of SUP reduction, while
   perceived cost advantage of plastics (b = 0.390) was the only predictor
   of SUP consumption. This study also found that the mean reported level
   of plastic consumption varied across three different parts of Hoi An
   City, with the residents of Cham Island (an area with active
   environmental action programmes) consuming significantly fewer SUP
   products compared to those living in urban and suburban areas. A model
   of motivation to reduce plastic waste was finally discussed. In
   conclusion, besides the traditional approach of raising public knowledge
   on the plastic problem, it is suggested that imposing strict penalties
   for inappropriate disposal and increasing the price of SUP plastics may
   be the most effective ways to reduce SUP plastic waste at its sources.},

Abstract = {Plastics are used and collected in a highly mixed state, which restricts
   them from economical mechanical recycling. Single-use plastics (SUPs),
   mainly polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene
   terephthalate (PET), make up more than 2/3 of all plastics. They have
   the shortest service lives and therefore cause the most urgent pressure
   on the environment. Herein, a novel graft copolymer is synthesized and
   used to increase the elongation at break of the ternary plastic alloy by
   more than 7000\%, which shows great potential for processing mixed
   plastics on a large scale.},

Abstract = {Play is a common behaviour in wild cetaceans that includes the
   manipulation of natural, as well as artificial objects such as marine
   debris. Yet, very little is known about these interactions despite the
   potential impacts on cetacean health. We combined a detailed review of
   the scientific literature and social media with 12 years of observations
   to examine cetacean interactions with plastic litter. A total of 11
   odontocete species (Tursiops truncatus, Stenella longirostris, Delphinus
   delphis, Grampus griseus, Steno bredanensis, Stenella frontalis, Sotalia
   guianensis, Pseudorca crassidens, Orcinus orca, Globicephala melas and
   Physeter macrocephalus) were documented in 59 events carrying or
   throwing plastic litter with their head and/or flippers suggesting a
   form of play. Interactions occurred in the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian
   Ocean, Mediterranean, and Red Sea, with single-use plastics composing
   the main typology registered. While these interactions appeared harmless
   to the observers, they can pose a significant risk through subsequent
   entanglement or ingestion.},

Title = {High incidence of false biodegradability claims related to single-use
   plastic utensils sold in Brazil},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION},

Abstract = {Replacing single-use plastic with so-called biodegradable ones have
   emerged as part of suitable actions to reduce global environmental
   impacts. However, issues related to false claims and improper
   certification of single-use plastic utensils (SUP) claiming
   biodegradability have been reported in scientific literature. Still,
   greenwashing incidences have not been systematically evaluated, and such
   approach may be useful to produce information to guide a proper
   legislative framework within the sector. The present study aims to
   quantitatively estimate the incidence of greenwashing among single-use
   utensils offered for sale in the Brazilian market. The assessments were
   carried out in forty supermarkets localized in four Brazilian cities.
   The labels of SUP utensils claiming biodegradability were identified and
   carefully inspected considering claims, seals, composition, technical
   standards, and prices. Forty-nine different products were found claiming
   biodegradability, including cups, cutlery, straws, plates, trays,
   tablecloths, lids, balloons, party ware and jars. Expressions as ``100\%
   Eco Friendly{''}, ``100 \% Recyclable{''} and ``Ecological and
   Biodegradable{''} were read on 42.9, 20.4 and 8.2 \% of analyzed items,
   respectively. In addition, 93.8 \% claimed to contain pro-oxidant
   additives (mostly d2w -{[}10.2 \%] and Eco Ventures bioplastics + Go
   Green P-life {[}20.4 \%]), being categorized as oxo-biodegradable
   materials, and 6.2 \% were made of regular polymers with no additives.
   The technical standards ASTM D6954-04 and SPCR 141 were descripted by 40
   and 16 labels, respectively. On average, products claiming
   biodegradability were 125 \% more expensive than their equivalents.
   Considering that the biodegradability of oxo-polymers has been widely
   refuted by scientific literature, our results indicates that none of the
   products claiming biodegradability sold in Brazilian supermarkets are,
   in fact, biodegradable. These results indicate that legislative
   frameworks on production and sale of plastic utensils must adopt
   measures to combat greenwashing practices, especially in countries that
   are big generators of plastic waste like Brazil.},

   Single-Use Plastic Waste in Taiwan},

Abstract = {The social impacts of prevailing circular economy (CE) strategies remain
   under-researched despite the considerable attention that CE has received
   from scholars and in industry. Existing CE indicators primarily focus on
   business models from a decision-making standpoint, overlooking consumer
   engagement and alternative solutions. Boasting one of the highest
   recycling rates globally, Taiwan faces challenges in optimizing
   collected resources. This study delves into recycling plastic waste by
   integrating consumer behavior within CE strategies, leveraging
   open-source resources and additive manufacturing technologies to align
   with the United Nations Agenda 2030, particularly Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs) 4 (Quality Education), 12 (Responsible
   Consumption and Production), and 13 (Climate Action). These resources
   facilitate the transformation of plastic waste into reusable materials.
   Employing an exploratory and participatory action research approach,
   this research uses the Precious Plastic Universe (PPU) database to
   identify potential resources from post-consumer polymer waste.
   Subsequently, it explores tools for converting collected waste into
   usable polymers. Lastly, the study investigates integrating collected
   polymer waste into student design projects to enhance creativity and
   problem-solving skills for sustainable development, employing additive
   manufacturing tools at the National Taiwan Normal University Department
   of Design. Thematic analysis of the data revealed several recurring
   patterns, including the role of consumer behavior in plastic waste
   generation, the development of creativity and problem-solving skills
   among students, and the challenges of working with recycled materials.
   These themes were observed in quantitative data (collected single-use
   polymers) and qualitative insights from student observations and
   interviews. Through thematic analysis, the study highlights key factors
   contributing to successful CE integration, providing a model for future
   educational and industrial applications of sustainable design.},

Abstract = {Interlocking paving bricks were produced with plastic wastes and sand
   using heating technique without other cementing or binding agent and
   water. Waste single-use plastics - polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
   bottles and low density polyethylene (LDPE) sachet water films used
   respectively were sourced from dump site, washed, air dried, melted and
   mixed with sand of not more than 2 mm particle size to produce
   interlocking paving brick (IPB). Sand-plastic mix ratios of 1:1, 1:3 and
   3:1 and metal mould of 190 x 90 x 90 mm dimension were used. The
   compressive strength, flexural tensile strength, abrasion and
   water-absorption test results showed that IPB from LDPE-sand composite
   has better mechanical performance than IPB from PET-sand composite for
   all the mix ratios. The IPB from LDPE-sand composite of 3:1 mix ratio
   had a compressive strength of 31.11 N/mm(2) and water absorption of
   0.33\% of its dry weight whereas its PET counterpart had compressive
   strength of 13.1 N/mm(2) and water absorption of 0.5\%. Scanning
   electron microscope (SEM) and abrasion results also showed that LDPE had
   better compatibility with sand particles. Waste single-use plastics can
   be used to produce high quality interlocking paving brick without cement
   and water and as well reduce the menace of waste PET bottles and LDPE
   films in our environment.},

Title = {At-sea solid waste production by a small-scale fishery in Peru},

Year = {2024},
Volume = {42},

Abstract = {Marine litter is a growing environmental problem for which
   fisheries-sourced waste remains poorly understood. In Peru, there is an
   ongoing challenge of waste management from the small-scale fisheries
   fleet given the lack of facilities to receive the variety of debris
   produced by fishers, which includes hazardous wastes such as batteries.
   In this study, onboard solid waste production was monitored daily by
   land-based observers upon landing at the port of Salaverry, Peru, from
   March to September 2017. The analysed small-scale gillnet and longline
   fishing fleets produced annually an estimated 11,260 kg of solid waste.
   Of particular concern is the production of single use plastics (3427 kg)
   and batteries (861 kg) due to their potential long-lasting impacts on
   the environment and challenges related to their proper disposal. A
   management plan for solid waste has been developed for Salaverry;
   therefore, a subsequent assessment was conducted in 2021-2022 of the
   behaviours and perceptions of fishers regarding the implementation of
   this plan. Most fishers (96\%) reported disposing of their waste on
   land, except organic waste which is disposed of at sea. While fishers in
   Salaverry have become more conscious of the issues surrounding at-sea
   waste disposal and have an interest in better segregating and managing
   their waste, there remains a need for improved waste management and
   recycling protocols and procedures at the port to make this possible.},

Title = {Applying the SOR framework to mitigate single-use plastic tableware
   consumption and why does it work? Solving the dissonance with an
   extended SOR framework},

Abstract = {Although plastic pollution is a critical environmental issue worldwide
   and household consumption of single-use plastic tableware (SUPT) is a
   growing concern, research on the determinants of SUPT use is deficient.
   In light of the prevalent and frequent use of SUPT, the far-reaching
   nature of its consumption, and its distinctive health concerns,
   compounded by the lack of dedicated regulations, this article sheds
   light on the SUPT problem and strives to minimize SUPT consumption. The
   Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) framework has been extensively applied
   in various contexts but not yet in the context of household SUPT
   consumption. In this study, we aim to fill the lacuna by examining the
   motives behind SUPT consumption using two online questionnaires in two
   Western countries that are known for relatively high domestic SUPT
   consumption: Israel (Study 1, n = 408) and the USA (Study 2, n = 295).
   Our findings indicate that personal attitudes toward the plastic problem
   ({''}organism{''} in the SOR taxonomy) mediate the relation between
   plastic health problem awareness ({''}stimulus{''}) and SUPT consumption
   ({''}response{''}). Moreover, we identified perceived behavioral control
   (PBC) as a significant predictor of behavior when behavior is not under
   volitional control (i.e., an action against the individual's
   self-interest), as in the SUPT context. Therefore, we propose expanding
   the SOR framework with the organism comprising attitude and PBC, thus
   supporting the dissonance theory (double mediation). We suggest that
   modifying personal attitudes toward the plastic problem by enhancing
   plastic health problem awareness may strengthen PBC and reduce SUPT
   consumption. Overall, this study deepens our understanding of SUPT
   consumption by highlighting the importance of attitude and PBC as
   mechanisms that link awareness to sustainable behavior.},

Title = {Comparative life cycle assessment of single-use cardiopulmonary bypass
   devices},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {425},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impacts of the common
   cardiopulmonary bypass device over its life cycle. This represents the
   first such assessment of a complex medical device, to the best of the
   authors' knowledge. This study was motivated by practitioners' concerns
   over cardiopulmonary bypass devices constructed mainly of single -use
   plastics, such as polyvinyl chloride and polycarbonate. The open -source
   software OpenLCA was used to perform each life cycle assessment with
   respect to ten common impact categories: global warming, eutrophication,
   acidification, smog, human health cancer, human health non -cancer,
   water intake, human health air pollutants, ecotoxicity, and natural
   resource depletion. The environmental impact was evaluated using the
   Building for Environmental and Economic Sustainability impact assessment
   method. To quantify the uncertainty in the results, Monte Carlo
   simulation was used using 5000 runs. A comparative assessment was
   conducted to determine the potential trade-offs in each impact category
   of using alternative construction materials. Incineration as a common
   disposal option could contribute up to 33 \% of total CO2 equivalent
   emissions over the life cycle of the device. Another 33\% of total CO2
   equivalent emissions are attributed to polycarbonate used in the
   construction of devices. Polycarbonate was also implicated as the top
   contributor to the other impact categories considered, except for human
   health cancer, which is almost entirely affected by the use of polyvinyl
   chloride in the device, primarily in the tubes. The accuracy of these
   results is corroborated by the uncertainty analysis. Lastly, the results
   show that replacing polycarbonate with polyethylene terephthalate,
   polypropylene, or polyethylene would be no worse than polycarbonate and
   provide a significant decrease in almost every impact category.
   Cardiopulmonary bypass devices are constructed primarily of single -use
   plastics that have relatively significant impacts in the 10 common
   categories considered. Alternative disposal methods and replacement of
   polycarbonate with alternative plastics could dramatically reduce the
   effects in most impact categories.},

Abstract = {The probabilistic hesitant elements (PHFEs) are a beneficial
   augmentation to the hesitant fuzzy element (HFE), which is intended to
   give decision-makers more flexibility in expressing their biases while
   using hesitant fuzzy information. To extrapolate a more accurate
   interpretation of the decision documentation, it is sufficient to
   standardize the organization of the elements in PHFEs without
   introducing fictional elements. Several processes for unifying and
   arranging components in PHFEs have been proposed so far, but most of
   them result in various disadvantages that are critically explored in
   this paper. The primary objective of this research is to recommend a
   PHFE unification procedure that avoids the deficiencies of operational
   practices while maintaining the inherent properties of PHFE
   probabilities. The prevailing study advances the hypothesis of
   permutation on PHFEs by suggesting a new sort of PHFS division and
   subtraction compared with the existing unification procedure.
   Eventually, the proposed PHFE-unification process will be used in this
   study, an innovative PHFEs based on the Weighted Aggregated Sum Product
   Assessment Method-Analytic Hierarchy Process (WASPAS-AHP) perspective
   for selecting flexible packaging bags after the prohibition on
   single-use plastics. As a result, we have included the PHFEs-WASPAS in
   our selection of the most effective fuzzy environment for bio-plastic
   bags. The ranking results for the suggested PHFEs-MCDM techniques
   surpassed the existing AHP methods in the research study by providing
   the best solution. Our solutions offer the best bio-plastic bag
   alternative strategy for mitigating environmental impacts.},

Abstract = {Currently, single-use plastic bag consumption and disposal are a global
   concern. The main aim of this study was to examine the logic and
   behaviors behind tendencies toward plastic bag use, determine the amount
   of plastic bag consumption, and assess the current regulation and
   condition of management of plastic bags in Iran. The plastic bag
   consumption rate was estimated using a web-based cross-sectional,
   self-reported survey questionnaire. Meanwhile, a questionnaire was
   developed in Google form to evaluate consumer behaviors and attitudes.
   Totally, 1834 people participated in the study done with accessed
   sampling method. The independent sample t test, Pearson's correlation,
   one-way analysis of variance, and chi-square test were used in data
   analysis. A combination of methods was used to assess current regulation
   and management. Then, some potential intervention strategies are
   presented for problem mitigation. The single-use plastic bag consumption
   is estimated to be 0.83 per capita per day, 69.72 million per day, and
   25.45 billion per year in the country, while their waste is generally
   disposed of in dumpsites and unsanitary landfills or scattered in the
   environment. About 92.7\% of Iran's people utilize single-use plastic
   bags, and their easy (free) availability is announced as the main reason
   for using them. However, the interesting point is that 86.7\% of people
   do a kind of secondary use of plastic bags, and 92.4\% are familiar with
   the major environmental effects of plastic bags. The majority of people
   (78.2\%) agree and compromise for putting in the application of a kind
   of strategy for plastic bag minimization. So, applying practical
   interventions and policies such as banning the free presentation of
   bags, introducing some kinds of tax, and simultaneously better
   management of waste bags are necessary to reduce relevant environmental
   effects.},

Title = {CO2 Emissions from Plastic Consumption Behaviors in Thailand},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Plastic waste is an environmental crisis that is becoming increasingly
   well-documented. The rapid expansion of plastic manufacturing and
   consumption has led to a harmful cycle of pollution and greenhouse gas
   emissions due to petroleum-based production and plastic waste disposal.
   Plastic production and disposal depend on the consumption behavior of
   people. This study aimed to examine the plastic consumption behavior in
   Thailand and its impact on climate change at the end-of-life stage. The
   general information, plastic consumption, and plastic waste management
   were collected via questionnaires for each product lifetime, including
   single-use, medium-use, and long-use plastics. Based on 567
   questionnaires, the results showed that people consumed single-use
   plastic, e.g., plastic bag, food container, cutlery, straws, and
   bottles, at a rate of about nine pieces/household/day or three
   pieces/cap/day. The medium-use and long-use plastic were 10
   pieces/household/month and 50 pieces/household/year, respectively. It
   should be remarked that population density, education, and number of
   household members affected plastic consumption behavior, especially for
   single-use plastic. Regarding the disposal of end-of-life plastics, Thai
   people, on average, contribute 0.15 kg CO(2)eq/household/day to climate
   change. Many households have mismanaged waste by open dumping and open
   burning. Therefore, practicing proper waste management will help
   Thailand on the path to carbon neutrality in the future.},

Abstract = {Plastic overproduction and the resulting increase in consumption has
   made plastic pollution ubiquitous in all ecosystems. Recognizing this,
   the United Nations (UN) has started negotiations to establish a global
   treaty to end plastic pollution, especially in the marine environment.
   The basis of the treaty has been formulated in terms of turning off the
   tap, signaling the will to prevent plastic pollution at its source.
   Based on the distribution of plastic production by sector, the plastic
   packaging sector consumes the most plastic. The volume and variety of
   chemicals used in plastic packaging, most of which is single-use, is a
   major concern. Single-use plastics including packaging is one of the
   most dominant sources of plastic pollution. Plastic waste causes
   pollution in water, air and soil by releasing harmful chemicals into the
   environment and can also lead to exposure through contamination of food
   with micro- and nano-plastic particles and chemicals through packaging.
   Marine life and humans alike face risks from plastic uptake through
   bioaccumulation and biomagnification. While the contribution of plastics
   ingested to chemical pollution is relatively minor in comparison to
   other pathways of exposure, the effect of plastic waste on marine life
   and human consumption of seafood is beyond question. To reduce the
   long-term impact of plastic, it is crucial to establish a global legally
   binding instrument to ensure the implementation of upstream rather than
   downstream solutions. This will help to mitigate the impact of both
   chemicals and microplastics, including from packaging, on the
   environment.},

Abstract = {Discharge from unrestricted tobacco products with filters (TPF) causes
   environmental damage. To reduce TPF litter quantities, Directive (EU)
   2019/904 requires TPF producers to proportionally contribute to the
   costs of discarding their products in public waste collection systems,
   including litter waste ones. An appropriate output-based cost model
   requires assessing TPF quantities in relevant waste streams. Currently,
   there is no comprehensive data available on TPF quantities in municipal
   solid waste (MSW). Therefore, a case study was conducted to quantify TPF
   in MSW. This study aimed to determine TPF quantities (1) in residual
   waste from four German district types and (2) in waste from public
   collection systems for three settlement structures within Trier City.
   Relevant waste streams from public collection systems, namely waste from
   public waste receptacles, street-cleaning waste and sinkhole residues,
   were identified. For both sampling campaigns, consideration was given to
   extrapolating the results to a larger scale. The results showed that the
   average specific TPF quantities in residual waste were 277.7, 271.8,
   193.3 and 204.5 gi- 1a- 1 in the selected city district, urban district,
   densely populated rural district and sparsely populated rural district,
   respectively. Extrapolation of these results to Germany yielded a
   specific TPF quantity in residual waste of 250.3 gi-1a-1. The average
   specific TPF quantities in waste from public waste receptacles,
   street-cleaning waste and sinkhole residues were 12.2, 47.4 and 9.9
   gi-1a- 1, respectively. The results could contribute to cost model
   development based on Directive (EU) 2019/904.},

Title = {Unraveling the catalytic activity of CaClOH-rich incineration fly ash in
   the pyrolysis of single-use plastics},
Journal = {MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In recent years, increased population and economic growth have resulted
   in an explosion in demand, production, and disposal of non-biodegradable
   commodity plastics. Pyrolysis, the anaerobic thermo-chemical breakdown
   of plastics such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and
   polystyrene (PS) into lower molecular weight hydrocarbons with
   applications as fuels, waxes, and lubricants, has emerged as one of the
   most promising industrial technologies for the end-of-life treatment of
   plastics. While a range of inorganic materials have shown efficacy in
   catalyzing plastic pyrolysis and reducing their energetic demands, the
   use of existing inexpensive waste materials such as incineration fly ash
   (IFA) for this application has largely been overlooked. Herein, we
   demonstrate the viability of IFA as a catalyst for the pyrolysis of PE,
   PP, and PS, which account for almost 60\% of all the waste plastics
   produced globally. The presence of IFA improved reaction conversions and
   liquid yields and resulted in positive outcomes for the pyrolysis of
   real-life plastic waste such as high density polyethylene (HDPE)
   detergent bottles and low density polyethylene (LDPE) plastic bags.
   Specifically, the pyrolysis of virgin HDPE pellets with IFA showed
   increased conversion from 46.7\% to 92.8\% and liquid yield from 35.1\%
   to 81.6\%, respectively. Through a set of control experiments, we
   determined that the catalytic activity of IFA could be attributed mainly
   to calcium hydroxychloride (CaClOH), which differed from other common
   calcium-containing minerals such as calcium oxide (CaO) and calcium
   chloride (CaCl2). Our findings demonstrate the unique catalytic
   possibilities offered by overlooked waste materials such as IFA in the
   upcycling of single-use plastics into liquid hydrocarbons and offer new
   insights on the use of different calcium-based cat-alysts for plastic
   pyrolysis.\& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a global health and economic crisis,
   significantly impacting coastal and marine environments. Lockdowns and
   restrictions, while necessary for public health, led to both positive
   and negative environmental consequences. Reduced human activity resulted
   in decreased pollution and habitat disruption, allowing for ecosystem
   recovery and improved water quality. However, the surge in single-use
   plastics and personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic
   exacerbated plastic pollution. Additionally, the economic downturn
   severely affected coastal communities reliant on tourism and fisheries,
   highlighting the need for sustainable recovery strategies. This Special
   Issue explores these collateral effects, emphasizing the importance of
   adaptive management and resilient governance in safeguarding coastal and
   marine ecosystems against future crises.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Mismanaged and excessive waste has adverse effects on natural
   environments, economies, and human health. To address these waste
   issues, the Sustainability with Awareness and Prevention Solutions
   Program was developed and implemented in communities along the
   Mississippi Gulf Coast (USA) with the aim to provide the knowledge and
   actions needed to reduce or eliminate mismanaged and excessive waste.
   The program uses four educational modules focused on (1) microplastics
   in the watershed, (2) food waste, (3) single-use plastics, and (4)
   involvement in community prevention and removal programs. The program
   curriculum was written to meet education standards in Mississippi for
   5th grade gifted, 6-8th grades, and 9-12th grades, and can be easily
   adapted to other states' curriculums. The program provides material
   incentives to participants so knowledge learned can immediately be
   translated to behavior change. The program is continually being
   developed to find the best methods to implement behavior change at
   multiple scales.},

Title = {Multiuse Polystyrene Plates for Phasing Out Single-Use Plastics:
   Chemical Performances and Environmental Impact Assessment Through a Life
   Cycle Approach},

Abstract = {European governments are addressing plastic pollution by implementing
   the Directive EU 2019/904 that bans single-use items like cutlery,
   plates, straws, and beverage stirrers. One strategy proposed by several
   industries to continue their production is the conversion of single-use
   items into multiuse items. Herein, the focus is on the production of
   polystyrene reusable plates and the suitability of this product for
   microwave and dishwasher use is assessed: in proper conditions, the
   structure is preserved without cuts or visible deformations, and the
   chemical stability is guaranteed. To get a full picture of the benefits
   and impacts of this new product, a life cycle assessment methodology is
   applied to compare the performances of one reusable plate with 20
   single-use plates. Results indicate that proper use is crucial: a
   reusable plate disposed after one use is more impactful than a
   single-use plate. In contrast, the reuse of plates for 20 times allows
   to reduce carbon footprint and acidification potential. Eutrophication
   and ozone layer depletion, on the other hand, increase due to the
   washing phase. The solutions that can mitigate these issues and enhance
   the sustainability of the reusable plates include the improvement of the
   detergent compositions and the use of electricity from renewable
   sources.
   The conversion from single-use to multiple-use items has been devised as
   a strategy to reduce plastic pollution. Life cycle assessment has been
   performed to compare the environmental impacts of one reusable
   polystyrene plate (20 uses) with 20 single-use plates. Multiple uses
   significantly reduce global warming and acidification; however,
   eutrophication and ozone layer depletion increase due to the washing
   step.image (c) 2024 WILEY-VCH GmbH},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in plastic used for medical
   purposes such as personal protective equipment and packaging materials.
   A very low share of plastics is recycled while the majority is sent to
   landfills. This plastic may degrade over time to form microplastics
   which may pollute land, air, and water sources. An increase in
   microplastics can increase the disease risk in human well-being's. The
   ultimate fate of microplastic is accumulation inside the human body
   posing the risk of different health conditions like cancer, diabetes,
   and allergic reactions. Hence, proper detection and disposal methods
   should be devised to deal with the rise in microplastic pollution.},

Title = {The human dimension of plastic pollution in the Caribbean SIDS of
   Trinidad and Tobago},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {159},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The development of effective interventions tackling plastic pollution
   should consider the human dimension behind the issue. To ensure that
   solutions are tailored to the Global South, specifically the realities
   of Small Island Developing States (SIDS), we recommend assessing
   location-specific behavioural drivers. This study (i) assesses the
   current behaviours of Trinbagonians related to their use and disposal of
   plastics, (ii) explores the drivers of behaviour (plastic usage and
   disposal), policy support and behavioural intentions to reduce plastic
   consumption and, (iii) makes suggestions in order to foster
   evidence-based interventions. A co-created online questionnaire designed
   to collect information from Trinbagonians relating to plastics was
   conducted over 15 weeks (May to August 2022). We find that the frequency
   of single-use plastic use was driven by individual and systemic factors,
   with the latter limiting recycling behaviours. Participants were
   supportive of policies to reduce plastic pollution and somewhat intended
   to reduce their own consumption. A complex pattern of
   sociopsychological, systemic and perception-based factors predicted
   participants' behaviour, behavioural intentions and policy support. The
   present study demonstrates that community perceptions can inform
   policy-making at two entry points: the consumption and the disposal of
   plastics. Based on our findings, we also point towards a suite of policy
   instruments that can be utilized in order foster more sustainable
   consumption patterns, reduce single-use plastics and promote recycling
   to reduce recyclables in landfills. Understanding the human dimension of
   environmental issues is crucial for designing targeted and effective
   interventions that resonate with specific local realities.},

Abstract = {Understanding the use behaviours of plastic items within households is
   important to enable informed policy development, particularly with the
   emerging and developing global plastic treaty. A survey of 400 permanent
   residents in Portsmouth aimed to identify the general trends in
   single-use plastic product (SUPP) use and disposal, and their personal
   motivations and barriers to reducing and recycling plastic. This
   included identifying common influencers of attitudes such as
   environmental values, situational characteristics, psychological factors
   and the individual demographic characteristics of residents. Key factors
   in consumer behaviour were found to be product availability,
   affordability and convenience. Often, less conveniently recycled
   plastics more frequently end up in landfill such as films, shopping bags
   and personal care items. The age of respondents was found to be the most
   significantly associated demographic with SUPP consumption, reuse and
   recycling behaviours. Other demographic variables such as a resident's
   location within the city, income and vehicle ownership were potential
   drivers influencing individual attitudes and their incentives towards
   reducing and recycling their plastic waste. The findings from this study
   brought to light the importance of effective local plastic governance.
   This study also identified consumer perceptions and behaviours that
   could contribute to future holistic plastic policy recommendations.},

Abstract = {The large number of medical conferences held per year has a significant
   impact on the environment. Climate change and global warming then lead
   to deleterious effects on human health. We aim to highlight that it is
   our responsibility as doctors to promote eco-friendly events and
   encourage sustainable practices, thus reducing harm to our environment.
   Management committees of conferences can take a few steps toward this
   with specific planning and effort. In this study, possible steps toward
   achieving this goal have been highlighted, such as conducting hybrid
   events, locally sourcing products, and avoiding single-use plastic.},

Abstract = {Japan implemented mandatory charging for single-use plastic shopping
   bags in 2020. In this study, we verified the policy effect and its
   persistence by analyzing the changes in the number of plastic shopping
   bags taken and discarded by consumers before and after the charging came
   into effect. Online surveys were conducted in 2016, 2021, 2022, and 2023
   for consumers residing in municipalities in Tokyo. The results showed
   that the number of plastic shopping bags taken decreased to
   approximately 30\% after the charging was implemented, from 5.8 bags per
   person per week in 2016 to 1.7-1.9 in 2021-2023, and the number of bags
   discarded decreased from 6.2 to 3.0-3.4. The number of bags taken in
   2021-2023 after the charging was implemented did not change
   significantly. Regarding the relationship with other waste policies, in
   municipalities that have introduced designated trash bags, the number of
   plastic shopping bags taken and discarded was fewer than in other
   municipalities even before the charging was introduced, by removing the
   option of reusing plastic bags as trash bags. This result indicates
   that, when introducing such policies, the relationship with existing
   waste policies must be analyzed to predict their effect.},

Title = {A systematic literature review of voluntary behaviour change approaches
   in single use plastic reduction},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {336},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Plastic waste is a leading contributor to climate change due to its
   build up in landfill and oceans, releasing harmful greenhouse gases and
   causing harm to ecosystems. The past decade has seen a rise in the
   number of policies and legislative regulations surrounding the use of
   single-use plastics (SUP). Such measures are needed and have shown
   effectiveness in the reduction of SUP's. However, it is becoming
   apparent that voluntary behaviour change efforts, which preserve
   autonomous decision making are also needed to further reduce demand for
   SUP. This mixed-methods systematic review had three aims, 1) synthesise
   existing voluntary behavioural change interventions and approaches aimed
   at reducing SUP consumption, 2) assess the level of autonomy preserved
   in interventions, and 3) assess the extent of theory use in voluntary
   SUP reduction interventions. A systematic search was executed across six
   electronic databases. Eligible studies were peer-reviewed literature
   published in English between 2000 and 2022 reporting on voluntary
   behaviour change programs aimed at reducing the consumption of SUPs.
   Quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT).
   Overall, 30 articles were included. Due to the heterogenic nature of
   outcome data in included studies, meta -analytic analysis was not
   possible. However, data were extracted and narratively synthesised.
   Communication and informational campaigns were the most common
   intervention approach with most interventions taking place in community
   or commercial settings. There was limited theory use among included
   studies (27\% used theory). A framework was created using the criteria
   outlined by Geiger et al. (2021) to evaluate level of autonomy
   pre-served in included interventions. Overall, level of autonomy
   preserved in included interventions was low. This review highlights the
   urgent need for more research into voluntary SUP reduction strategies,
   increased inte-gration of theory in intervention development, and higher
   levels of autonomy preservation in SUP reduction interventions.},

Title = {Abolishing Single-Use Plastic Water Bottles in Dubai Hotels as a
   Voluntary Act-Scenarios and Environmental Impacts},

Abstract = {Dubai, a popular vacation spot, has launched an initiative to reduce
   reliance on single-use plastic water bottles. Tourists in Dubai widely
   utilize PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) water bottles, and significant
   quantities of greenhouse gases (GHG) are released during the production
   and disposal of PET bottles. In response to Dubai's initiative, some
   hotels eliminated PET bottles and substituted them with environmentally
   favorable alternatives. These hotels are considered adopters of the
   initiative, while other hotels that might follow are imitators. Thus,
   innovation diffusion theory (IDT) is used in this work to forecast the
   transition of hotels to non-PET bottles. The diffusion of this new
   behavior is simulated using a system dynamic (SD) model, where factors
   pushing imitators to abolish PET bottles are found using the Delphi
   method and hotel surveying. Moreover, the importance of each identified
   factor is found using an analytical hierarchical process (AHP). Since
   hotels are divided into several categories based on their service
   quality, the analysis shows that hotels are affected by other hotels in
   their category or better categories. Using this conceptual
   understanding, Bass and generalized Bass modeling are used in the SD
   model to study how imitating hotels will follow the adopters. Best-,
   average-, and worst-case scenarios are studied to help decision-makers
   understand what to expect in the future. For the best- and average-case
   scenarios, the SD simulation shows that all hotels will potentially have
   abolished PET bottles in 25 years. However, only 16\% of hotels will
   have cancelled PET bottles in 25 years if the worst-case scenario
   occurs; thus, decision-makers need to intervene to expedite the process.},

Title = {Replacing single-use plastics with biomaterial packaging in Thailand and
   impacts on the water-energy-climate Nexus},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION},

Abstract = {Despite the potential benefits of biomaterial packaging in reducing
   plastic waste, evaluating its environmental impact at a regional or
   national level is imperative. This study evaluated options for replacing
   single-use plastics in Thailand with biomaterial packaging. We focused
   on plastic bags, foam food boxes, and plastic trays and cups,
   considering their volume of consumption and end-of-life management in
   2020 as a base case. We examined the effects of this replacement on
   water scarcity, energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   throughout the life cycle, and the reduction of waste mismanagement.
   Based on our findings, the optimal approach to manufacturing
   biomaterials and managing their end-of-life phase could lower GHG
   emissions by 1980 kt CO2-eq per year, reduce landfill waste by 490 kt
   per year, and decrease mismanaged waste by 987 kt per year in comparison
   to the 2020 baseline (conventional plastics). However, to achieve this
   scenario, a remarkable amount of biomaterial is required. The demand for
   sugarcane as a feedstock for biomaterial production (15 million t/y)
   accounts for 20 \% of Thailand's total output or half of its sugar
   exports. However, the need for cassava as a feedstock for biomaterial
   production (1 million t/y) accounts for only 1 \% of the entire output
   or less than 10 \% of cassava exports. To enhance the productivity of
   biomass feedstocks, additional land and water resources will be
   necessary compared to the 2020 base case. This could result in a
   doubling of the water demand, which would exacerbate water scarcity
   compared to the 2020 base case. Using biomaterials in packaging can be
   an effective way to decrease plastic waste and its related environmental
   impacts. However, proper waste management should be prioritized.
   Policymakers should carefully consider the environmental impacts and
   resource security implications of bio-based packaging.},

Abstract = {It is greenwashing to affix to a product a label claiming
   biodegradability if the product is not biodegradable, but Moreno et al.
   had not taken the fundamental step, to determine whether the products
   were biodegradable or not. A polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP)
   product properly made with a reputable oxo-biodegradable masterbatch
   will fully biodegrade much more quickly than ordinary plastic in the
   open environment, without leaving microplastics or harmful residues. No
   special conditions are necessary. Oxo-biodegradable plastics,
   oxo-degradable plastics, and plastics marketed as ``compostable{''} are
   completely different technologies and should not be confused. Samples of
   oxo-biodegradable plastic should not be tested in conditions unlikely to
   be experienced by plastic litter in the open environment, and should not
   be so heavily stabilised as to be unlikely to degrade in any realistic
   timescale.},

Title = {Integrating Lean Management and Circular Economy for Sustainable
   Dentistry},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The increasing focus on environmental sustainability has prompted the
   healthcare sector, including dentistry, to reconsider waste management
   practices. Dental offices generate various waste streams from outdated
   technologies, including single-use plastics, hazardous materials, and
   digital waste. This scoping review explores how integrating circular
   economy principles with lean management practices can enhance
   sustainability and operational efficiency in dental clinics. Using the
   PRISMA methodology, the review identifies 30 articles that passed the
   Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Critical Appraisal Skills Program
   (CASP) checklist from 2000. Circular economy principles focus on
   reducing waste and maximizing resource reuse, while lean management
   seeks to improve efficiency and minimize process waste. Together, these
   approaches can significantly reduce resource consumption and enhance
   recycling efforts in dental practices. Despite barriers such as high
   technology costs, regulatory constraints, and limited recycling
   infrastructure, case studies highlight successful implementation in
   healthcare settings, demonstrating improved environmental and
   operational outcomes. Collaboration between dental professionals,
   policymakers, and industry leaders is essential for promoting the
   adoption of these sustainable practices.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastics such as straws have caused intricate environmental
   challenges since they are not readily assimilated into nature at the end
   of life. Paper straws, on the contrary, become soggy and collapse in
   drinks resulting in an obnoxious user experience. Here, all-natural,
   biocompatible, degradable straws and thermoset films are engineered by
   integrating economical natural resources-lignin and citric acid-into
   edible starch and poly(vinyl alcohol), making them the casting slurry.
   The slurries were cast on a glass substrate, partially dried, and rolled
   on a Teflon rod to fabricate the straws. The straws are perfectly
   adhered at the edges by the strong hydrogen bonds from the
   crosslinker-citric acid-during drying, thus eliminating the need for
   adhesives and binders. Further, curing the straws and films in a vacuum
   oven at 180 degrees C results in enhanced hydrostability and endows the
   films with excellent tensile strength, toughness, and ultraviolet
   radiation shielding. The functionality of the straws and films surpassed
   paper and plastic straws, making them quintessential candidates for
   all-natural sustainable development.},

Abstract = {The issue of marine plastic contamination has been raising concern for a
   long time. Despite the difficulties Vietnam faces, there are relatively
   few studies related to the assessment of potential leaked plastic
   sources into the marine environment. A large amount of marine debris was
   predicted to come from land-based plastic waste sources in coastal areas
   with high population densities. This research provides the data on the
   amount of daily generated plastic waste, behaviors and perception on
   plastic waste in riverside and coastal households in Da Nang City,
   Vietnam. The results indicate that the waste generation rate was 311.1
   g/cap/day of which plastic waste accounted for 18\%. Plastic bags were
   frequently used and discarded at the highest rate due to its convenience
   and accessibility. Meanwhile, the rate for plastic bags separation is
   relatively low (36.1\%). Single-use plastic for food stuffs and beverage
   is also a problem with highly frequent use. Instead, the rate of
   willingness to participate in reducing plastic bags usage is quite
   positive (approximately 70\%). To address these challenges, this study
   discusses on the policies and emphasises the importance of campaigns to
   minimise the consumption of single-use plastic at source, the education
   and outreach programs to modify disposal habits, etc.},

Abstract = {This study examines urban plastic waste generation using a citizen
   science approach in six Latin American countries during a global
   pandemic. The objectives are to quantify generation rates of masks,
   gloves, face shields, and plastic bags in urban households using online
   survey and perform a systematic cross-jurisdiction comparisons in these
   Latin American countries. The per capita total mask generation rates
   ranged from 0.179 to 0.915 mask cap(-1) day(-1). A negative correlation
   between the use of gloves and masks is observed. Using the average
   values, the approximate proportion of masks, gloves, shields, and
   single-use plastic bags was 34:5:1:84. We found that most studies
   overestimated face mask disposal rate in Latin America due to the
   simplifying assumptions on the number of masks discarded per person,
   masking prevalence rate, and average mask weight. Unlike other studies,
   end-of-life PPE quantities were directly counted and reported by the
   survey participants. Both of the conventional weight-based estimates and
   the proposed participatory survey are recommended in quantifying COVID
   waste. Participant' perception based on the Likert scale is generally
   consistent with the waste amount generated. Waste policy and regulation
   appear to be important in daily waste generation rate. The results
   highlight the importance of using measured data in waste estimates.},

Abstract = {While the ability of quickly vanishing in water has made starch-based
   plastics a potential solution to the current marine plastic issue caused
   by discarded single-use plastics, this ability also translates into lack
   of water resistance in daily scenario. Here, we aim to improve the water
   resistance of starch-based blend films in daily scenarios while allowing
   them to disintegrate and vanish rapidly in marine environments via the
   introduction of ionic crosslinks. A dialdehyde starch
   (DAS)/carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) blend film is prepared via a
   modified solution casting process, during which DAS is gradually
   rendered cationic by a cationizing reagent, Girard's reagent T, and
   interacts with CMC to form ionic crosslinks. Meanwhile, the aldehyde
   groups on DAS also form acetal bonds with the -OH groups on both DAS and
   CMC, which further increases the wet strength. In solutions of low ionic
   strength encountered in daily life, such as freshwater, the film remains
   stable for both types of crosslinks. In high-ionic-strength solutions,
   such as seawater, the film swells rapidly and disintegrates owing to the
   cleavage of ionic crosslinks. This study demonstrated ionic crosslink
   could be a potential solution for balancing the protection of marine
   ecosystem and ease of use of starch-based blend films, which is
   essential to the development of future marine ecosystem-friendly
   single-use plastics.},

Title = {Game-Based Solutions and the Plastic Problem: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution is an urgent worldwide environmental issue affecting
   marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. Half of the global
   plastic production is dedicated to items only used once: the so-defined
   single-use plastic (SUP) items. Different strategies have been
   implemented to reduce SUP consumption. Game-based solutions are an
   emerging strategy to favour behaviour change. The present systematic
   review aims at providing a synthesis of the current evidence about the
   use of game-based solutions to encourage sustainable behaviours
   concerning plastic (i.e., consumption, avoidance, waste management,
   pollution). Relevant studies were identified via three databases:
   Scopus, ProQuest and Web of Science for qualifying papers published
   between 2015 and 2021. Twenty-two studies that employed or designed
   game-based interventions to address the plastic problem were included.
   Results suggest that there is still little research exploring the use of
   game-based solutions to address the plastic issue. The studies included
   in this review mostly aim at changing behaviours and raising awareness
   towards plastic pollution among the general public. Although findings
   suggest that game-based intervention can be promising in terms of
   engagement and motivation and increasing knowledge of the issue, there
   is still little research focused on proving actual behaviour change,
   especially over time and in different settings.},

Abstract = {Microplastics (MP), small plastic particles under 5 mm, are pollutants
   known to carry heavy metals in ecosystems. Composts are a significant
   source of soil microplastics. This study examined MSW composts from
   Kochi and Kozhikode in India for microplastic concentrations and heavy
   metals' accumulation thereon. Microplastics were isolated using zinc
   chloride density separation, with Fenton's reagent used for organic
   matter oxidation. Resin types were identified using FTIR analysis that
   showed the presence of PE, PP, PS, nylon, PET, and allyl alcohol
   copolymer. In Kozhikode's compost, the average concentration of
   microplastics was 840 +/- 30 items/kg, while Kochi had 1600 +/- 111
   items/kg, mainly polyethylene films. PE was the most prevalent resin,
   comprising 58.3\% in Kozhikode and 73.37\% in Kochi. Heavy metal
   analysis of MP showed significant concentrations of lead, cadmium, zinc,
   copper, and manganese adsorbed on the surface of microplastics. The
   concentrations of heavy metals in the MP before Fenton oxidation ranged
   from 1.02 to 2.02 times the corresponding concentrations in compost for
   Kozhikode and 1.23 to 2.85 times for Kochi. Source apportionment studies
   revealed that 64\% of microplastics in Kozhikode and 77\% in Kochi
   originated from single-use plastics. Ecological risk indices, PLI and
   PHI, showed that composts from both locations fall under hazard level V.
   The study revealed that compost from unsegregated MSW can act as a
   significant source of microplastics and heavy metals in the soil
   environment, with single-use plastics contributing major share of the
   issue.},

Title = {Global scoping review of behavioral interventions to reduce plastic
   pollution with recommendations for key sectors},

Abstract = {End users of single-use plastics can help minimize their contribution to
   plastic pollution via mindful purchasing and waste management. These
   behaviors can be impacted via behavior change interventions in various
   key sectors of society. This review set out to summarize recent
   (2015-2023) peer-reviewed evidence on interventions aimed at changing
   the plastic consumption, recycling, and/or littering behaviors of
   individuals across four sectors: business and retail, tourism and
   leisure, schools and education, and communities. Systematic literature
   searches were conducted across multiple databases and resulted in the
   inclusion of 92 intervention studies. Information on intervention
   strategy and effectiveness was extracted, and the studies were assessed
   for risk of bias. Intervention descriptions and outcomes were coded into
   five intervention categories (informational, contextual, prompts,
   social, and personal strategies) and synthesized qualitatively to inform
   future practice in an accessible manner. Although nearly half of the
   reviewed studies were assessed as having moderate-to-high risk of bias
   (e.g., lacked reliability assessment of outcome measures), limiting
   confidence in the documented findings, the review concludes that
   different strategies work in different sectors. For example,
   informational strategies showed mostly promising results in most
   sectors, but had mixed effectiveness in the education sector, while
   contextual modifications were effective across sectors.

Title = {An investigation of the environmental implications of bioplastics:
   Recent advancements on the development of environmentally friendly
   bioplastics solutions},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {The production and utilization of plastics may prove beneficial, but the
   environmental impact suggests the opposite. The single-use plastics
   (SUP) and conventional plastics are harmful to the environment and need
   prompt disposal. Bioplastics are increasingly being considered as a
   viable alternative to conventional plastics due to their potential to
   alleviate environmental concerns such as greenhouse gas emissions and
   pollution. However, the previous reviews revealed a lack of consistency
   in the methodologies used in the Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs), making
   it difficult to compare the results across studies. The current study
   provides a systematic review of LCAs that assess the environmental
   impact of bioplastics. The different mechanical characteristics of bio
   plastics, like tensile strength, Young's modulus, flexural modulus, and
   elongation at break are reviewed which suggest that bio plastics are
   comparatively much better than synthetic plastics. Bioplastics have more
   efficient mechanical properties compared to synthetic plastics which
   signifies that bioplastics are more sustainable and reliable than
   synthetic plastics. The key challenges in bioplastic adoption and
   production include competition with food production for feedstock, high
   production costs, uncertainty in end-of-life management, limited
   biodegradability, lack of standardization, and technical performance
   limitations. Addressing these challenges requires collaboration among
   stakeholders to drive innovation, reduce costs, improve end-of-life
   management, and promote awareness and education. Overall, the study
   suggests that while bioplastics have the potential to reduce
   environmental impact, further research is needed to better understand
   their life cycle and optimize their end-of-life (EoL) management and
   production to maximize their environmental benefits.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastic bags contribute significantly to the plastic
   pollution in South Africa posing a serious environmental challenge.
   Hence, there is a need for comprehensive strategies to reduce plastic
   bag consumption. We report the results of an online workshop aimed to
   create a positive, shared future vision. The workshop was attended by 12
   invited participants from diverse backgrounds and disciplines and
   utilized a collaborative approach to propose a framework for reducing
   plastic bag usage during grocery shopping in South Africa. The findings
   suggest that a combination of economic, structural and behavioral
   interventions is necessary to promote lasting behavior change, including
   financial incentives, a broad introduction of more environmentally
   friendly alternatives, and promoting bag reuse. Additionally, the vision
   underscored the importance of using social channels such as education
   and social norms. The invited stakeholders did not endorse conventional
   approaches such as increasing an already existing levy or implementing a
   complete ban on plastic bags. They also questioned the introduction of
   fully recycled plastic bags. Instead, the proposed vision encourages an
   integrated approach to reducing plastic bag usage involving individual
   behavior change and community engagement. The development of a creative
   product such as a video to showcase a future vision offers a powerful
   tool for communication with further stakeholders and political
   authorities, to engage with the community and broader population and for
   inspiring collective action. Overall, the findings have implications for
   policymakers, business leaders, environmental educators, and individuals
   committed to reducing plastic pollution and promoting sustainable
   practices in South Africa.},

Title = {Morphology and Polymeric Composition-Based Source Apportionment of
   Microplastics in Surface Water and Sediment of Drinking Water Supply
   Reservoirs in Ranchi, India},

Abstract = {We investigated the occurrence of microplastics (MPs), a burgeoning
   environmental pollutant, in three drinking water supplying reservoirs
   situated in Ranchi, India.Through comprehensive water and sediment
   samples analysis, the study attempted to evaluate spatial distribution,
   conduct morphological examinations, perform polymeric analysis, and
   conduct source apportionment to pinpoint significant contributors.
   Morphological examinations were conducted utilizing a stereomicroscope
   equipped with a fluorescence adapter, while polymeric composition
   analysis was done on FTIR. Additionally, various indices, such as the MP
   Diversity Index and Pollution Load Index, were calculated alongside
   other statistical analyses. The findings revealed the omnipresence of MP
   particles- fragments, films, fibers, and foams-in all 180 water samples
   (total count: 3699-6873) and 144 sediment samples (total count:
   1038-5166) at notably high concentrations. Eight polymer types could be
   identified from the FTIR analysis, with PET and HDPE dominance. ANOVA
   analysis indicated significant sediment differences among the
   reservoirs, although regression analysis did not show substantial
   particle settling from surface water to sediment. The MP Pollution Load
   Index classified two reservoirs as high-risk (Hazard level II). Finally,
   a source apportionment study based on the potential source items, their
   categories, relative score, and individual contributory score suggested
   single-use plastic items and household plastic items to be the major
   contributor to the MP contamination in these reservoirs.This source
   apportionment-driven model holds promise for addressing MP contamination
   in lakes and reservoirs worldwide, facilitating the identification of
   major contributing factors and informing stakeholders to develop
   policies in line with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 6 and SDG 14)
   for clean water systems.
   Microplastics were assessed in water and sediments of drinking water
   reservoirs.Fragmented microplastics were predominant, followed by
   fibers, films, and foam.Most abundant microplastic types were PET and
   HDPE polymers.Human settlements, tourism and recreation seemed to be
   major microplastic sources.Source apportionment indicated single-use
   plastic items as major contributors.},

Abstract = {In 2019, the National Assembly of Ecuador approved a law for the
   regulation of single-use plastics, resulting in this regulation being a
   great advance since the control of the use and waste of plastics has
   become an unsustainable problem in the country. Recycling is an
   alternative for the proper handling of plastics, not only in its
   collection and processing, but also in the proper cleaning, selection,
   and separation of the materials to be recycled. The plastic in the soil
   has a great impact, since over time it can affect the porosity of the
   soil and hinder the circulation of air, thus causing the reduction of
   fertility of farmland. The objective of this work is to analyze the
   information about the problem of contamination by plastic waste in the
   city of Babahoyo.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented demand for single-use
   plastics such as plastic bags and surgical masks. Plastics are resistant
   to natural degradation and are a global environmental pollution problem,
   threatening the environment and human health. Finding suitable ways to
   convert plastic waste into valuable materials is crucial to mitigate
   these effects. Herein, we report a facile, single-step, and organic
   solvent-free hydrothermal process to convert polyethylene-based plastic
   bags and polypropylene-based surgical masks into carbon dots with a 96\%
   production yield. The produced CDs are soluble in aqueous and various
   organic solvents, show excitation-dependent emission consistent with
   their size of 1-8 nm and exhibit thermal and photostability. We further
   show how this oxidative degradation approach can upcycle contaminated
   plastics with organic waste, which is a major challenge with plastic
   recycling. Finally, we demonstrate a potential use case of CDs as
   anticounterfeiting agents using fluorescent, stretchable films of
   CD-doped polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). This synthesis method is a
   cost-effective, easy-to-implement, highly scalable, and
   contamination-resistant approach to upcycle plastic waste.},

Abstract = {The global pandemic caused by COVID-19 has increased awareness of the
   need for best practices to prevent the transmission of virus diseases.
   Antimicrobial films have been employed in packaging food items to
   minimize the spread of foodborne illnesses. However, the ongoing
   COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the demand for novel antimicrobial
   materials to prepare packaging films to minimize the virus spread
   through food items during processing and transportation. Considering the
   environmental pollution caused by single-use plastics, the demand for
   biodegradable polymers for packaging films has also increased in the
   current pandemic. This review aims to outline emerging bio-based
   antimicrobial materials and their incorporation into biopolymers as
   carriers for antimicrobial films, highlighting their potential as
   effective measures in preparing for future pandemics.},

Abstract = {PurposeIn this study, the authors developed a conceptual model to
   investigate sustainable consumption behavior, specifically the intention
   to use reusable bags, and its relationship with two crucial factors
   influencing the use of single-use plastic bags: cost savings and
   convenience. This study also aims to explore the mediating roles of
   environmental concern, guilt and
   self-efficacy.Design/methodology/approachA quantitative study using
   online survey involving 421 respondents was conducted, and data analysis
   performed using structural equation modeling.FindingsThe results
   indicate that self-efficacy influenced environmental concern and
   sustainable consumption, while perceived savings did not. Perceived
   convenience significantly influenced sustainable consumption behavior.
   Environmental concern had indirect effects on the relationships between
   perceived savings, perceived convenience and sustainable consumption
   behavior, whereas guilt did not moderate the relationship between
   environmental concern and sustainable consumption
   behavior.Originality/valueThe main contribution lies in the insights for
   promoting the sustainable use of reusable shopping bags, benefiting both
   theoretical understanding and practical applications in efforts to
   encourage sustainable consumption behavior.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced personal protective equipment (PPE)
   litter into the environment since early 2020. These items are often made
   of plastic polymers and can degrade over time. This study quantified PPE
   litter abundance around Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. Plastic and
   PPE litter were collected at ten sites in September 2021. Items were
   weighed and categorized by type and plastic polymer. A total of 286
   items of PPE were found, comprising 2.9 \% of all plastic litter. Gloves
   were the most abundant type of PPE (n = 142), and PPE was found at an
   average density of 0.03 items m-1 and 0.19 g m-1. Compared to other
   coastal surveys conducted during the pandemic, PPE litter was present at
   higher proportions in Charleston Harbor. These results establish
   baseline levels of pandemic-related PPE litter in Charleston Harbor, and
   future research is necessary to quantify the environmental risks
   associated with PPE litter exposure.},

Abstract = {Global transitions to circular economies of plastic could pose both
   risks and opportunities for human health. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
   can help to quantify possible health effects across plastic life cycles,
   syntheses of which could inform policy. This systematic review assessed
   LCA evidence for health effects of increased plastic recycling and reuse
   in the food sector. Scientific databases including Web of Science,
   Scopus, MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, GreenFile and grey literature
   websites were searched for peer-reviewed LCA of consumer-level food
   sector plastics that compared virgin or single-use plastics with
   scenarios of increased recycling and reuse. Data on Human Health impacts
   and related midpoint impacts were extracted, converted to
   DisabilityAdjusted Life Years (DALYs), and analysed using
   meta-regression. Forty-nine eligible LCAs were identified, only five of
   which related to low- and middle-income countries (China: n = 1 and
   Thailand: n = 4). Metaregression showed strong evidence for a linear
   trend in reducing DALYs with increasing percentage recycled content
   compared to virgin plastic (Coefficient = -1.96E-5; 95\% CI = -2.69E-5
   to -1.24E-5; p < 0.0001) and increasing end-of-life recycling rate
   compared to landfill and/or incineration (Coefficient = -2.1E-5; 95\% CI
   = -2.60E-5 to -1.63E-5; p < 0.0001), equating to almost a day of healthy
   life saved globally per tonne of plastic recycled. On average, reusable
   plastics reduced climate-related health impacts associated with
   single-use plastics after 30 uses. Global assessment was limited by data
   deficits, but meta-analyses suggested that health risks from linear
   economies of food sector plastics could be reduced by increasing
   recycling and reuse rates, though some reusable plastics would need to
   be used many more times than current norms. Encouraging greater
   geographical coverage in LCA, increasing uptake of health impact
   assessment methods, and incorporating emerging health data will
   strengthen future public health evaluations of circular economies.},

Abstract = {This study assesses the often-overlooked environmental impact of waste
   transportation in the life cycle of polymer-based multilayer packaging
   (PMP) in New York State (NYS). Analyzing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)
   and energy consumption, the research includes various waste management
   scenarios, including landfilling, incineration, material recovery
   facilities (MRF) with chemical recycling (CR), and retail return with
   CR. The study maps existing waste management facilities, calculates
   travel distances, and introduces a proposed central CR facility.
   Findings reveal that compared to landfilling, transportation GHG
   emissions are higher for incineration (64 \%), MRF with CR (264 \%), and
   retail return with CR (158 \%). The research highlights the importance
   of well-distributed landfill locations over sparse CR and incineration
   sites, hindering plastic film recycling advancement in the US. The model
   introduces three new incinerators, reducing transport energy (28 \%) and
   GHG emissions (31 \%). This study stands as the most comprehensive
   assessment of transportation impacts on plastic film waste, offering a
   versatile model for research, policy, and facility siting.},

Title = {Product-based approach to sustainable plastic management focusing on
   consumers' necessity of 50 daily-use products in Japan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {In the plastic product lifecycle, consumers are the main stakeholders
   who purchase, consume, and dispose of plastic products. To be able to
   take optimal measures to induce changes in consumer behavior to achieve
   sustainable plastic management, daily-use plastic products should be
   classified by consumers' necessity. However, consumers' evaluations of
   the necessity of individual plastic products remain to be examined.
   Here, we selected 50 plastic products from the Japanese households that
   are used and disposed of by consumers on a daily basis, and then
   conducted a large-scale questionnaire survey of 10,000 residents of
   Japan in which we asked respondents to evaluate the subjective necessity
   and substitutability of each of the targeted 50 products. To discuss
   future measures tailored to individual products or groups of similar
   products, we conducted hierarchical clustering analysis based on the
   respondents' evaluation of each of the products. The classified seven
   clusters could be divided into two groups, which were characterized by a
   low and high necessity for consumers. In the four clusters characterized
   by a low necessity, most of the products were single-use plastic
   products and the rate of the options indicating a lack of necessity was
   more than 44\% for each product. In contrast, the other three clusters
   included plastic containers and packaging, durable products, and
   products made from synthetic fibers, but few single-use plastic
   products, and showed a higher response rate of more than 55\% for the
   options indicating necessity. Then we also investigated domestic
   consumption of each product and obtained the Japanese total consumption
   of the 50 targeted products as 3.619-4.007 million t per year. As a
   result of our estimation, if the consumers can stop their use of the
   unnecessary products or have access to suitable substitutes, millions of
   tons of products could be eliminated as a maximum reduction potential.
   Overall, our survey highlighted the importance of classification of
   plastic products based on the consumers' necessity and proposed possible
   targets of policy intervention on future sustainable management in terms
   of individual plastic products.},

Abstract = {Over the recent years, two environmental issues have gained much
   attention - pollution caused by single use plastics and pollution caused
   by disposal of agricultural residues in inappropriate ways like stubble
   burning. Consequently, scientists have been trying to develop materials
   to replace single use plastics as well as eco-friendly techniques for
   disposal and valorization of agricultural residues.The present study was
   planned to explore its utilisation for developing a compostable
   bio-polymer with polylactic acid (PLA) matrix and paddy straw powder
   (PSP) as a bio-filler. To enhance its ready degradation, paddy straw was
   pre-treated with NaOH before extrusion into granules. The composite
   granules were produced using a melt-mixing method, and their structure
   and morphology were analysed using scanning electron microscopy.
   Incorporation of paddy straw led to changes in the microstructure of the
   composites, and a homogeneous distribution of paddy straw fibres in the
   samples was observed. Furthermore, the nucleation effect in developed
   composite materials was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier
   transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. Each PLA-PSP composite exhibited
   variation in physical, morphological, thermal, and mechanical
   characteristics. Thermal degradation temperature of the composite
   material increased by more than 58 degrees C with increased
   concentration of PSP. While considering all the parameters, composite
   material with 30\% PSP concentration exhibited the most desirable
   characteristics in terms of balance of strength, thermal stability, and
   surface properties material. The PLA-30\%PSP composite material had a
   browning index of 39.04 +/- 1.69, degradation temperature of 382.70
   degrees C, glass transition temperature of 76.39 degrees C and impact
   strength of 62.37 +/- 5.63 J/m. This study provides an insight into
   development of structure of PLA-paddy straw fibre composites and their
   characterisation for potential application as eco-friendly, compostable
   alternative for food packaging.},

Abstract = {A new plastic ban has banned the use of single-use non-degradable
   plastic drinking straws in China's food and beverage industry by the end
   of 2020. However, this has caused widespread discussion and complaints
   on social media. What are consumers' reactions and what factors
   influence consumers to choose bio-straws (substitutes for plastic
   straws) are unclear. Therefore, this research collected 4367 effective
   comments (177,832 words in total) on ``bio-straws{''} from social media
   and extracted keywords based on grounded theory to generate
   questionnaires. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the
   consumption intention and influencing factors of 348 consumers regarding
   the ban. The results indicate the following: (1) consumer opinion on
   straws can be summarized into five main categories, namely, consumers'
   user experience, consumer subjectivity, policy awareness, policy
   acceptance, and consumption intention; (2) consumer subjectivity, policy
   awareness, and policy acceptance directly affect consumption intention
   significantly, while user experience affects consumption intention
   indirectly; and (3) user experience and consumer subjectivity play
   significant roles in mediating these relationships. From the perspective
   of consumers, this study provides an important basis for policymakers to
   formulate single-use plastic alternative policies in the future.},

   major environmental pollution, leading to an increase in microplastics
   in nature. To overcome this issue, biodegradable films are being
   explored more extensively. Seaweed is gaining prominence in the food
   packaging sector since it is beneficial in all aspects. Two fractions of
   Indian brown seaweed Sargassum wightii, biopolymer (sulfated
   polysaccharide {[}SP]) as base material and nanofillers (cellulose
   nanocrystals {[}CNC]) as reinforced filler are employed to develop a
   sustainable cling film for food packaging. This cellulose filler can be
   isolated from solid seaweed biomass after the polysaccharide extraction
   and converted into nanoform using the response surfaces method (RSM) to
   maximize the yield of CNC. The objective of this research is to
   construct seaweed-based biodegradable nanocomposite films and to examine
   their improved properties. It exhibited a gradual decrease in water
   absorption and water vapor permeability (WVP), along with better
   wettability, mechanical, and antioxidant properties, and thermal
   analysis compared with the control SP film. The degradation rates of the
   films were analyzed using the soil-burial method. According to the
   results obtained, it is suggested that CNC can be utilized as a
   functional filler to improve the qualities of seaweed-based cling films.},

Abstract = {Encouraging consumers to pay a premium for environmentally friendly food
   packaging is vital. This study examines consumers' willingness to pay a
   premium for environmentally friendly (reusable and sustainable) compared
   to single-use plastics (conventional) off-premises food packaging. Using
   the stimulus-organismresponse theory, two experimental studies were
   conducted. Study 1 shows the direct influence of environmentally
   friendly food packaging on consumer willingness to pay a premium for
   off-premises food packaging, and its indirect influence via
   pro-environmental self-identity and moral judgment. Study 2 confirms the
   indirect effects, while supporting the main effect only for the reusable
   option. This study also reveals that reputation and impact legacy
   motives moderate the serial mediation effect through pro-environmental
   self-identity and moral judgment. The findings suggest that foodservice
   businesses can encourage consumers, particularly those with strong
   legacy motives, to pay a premium for environmentally friendly
   off-premises food packaging by creating message appeals to their
   pro-environmental self-identity and moral judgment.},

Title = {Is environmental behavior related to economic risk preferences? An

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {AUG 3},
Abstract = {Do risk preferences play a role when deciding whether to act
   pro-environmentally? Looking at 28 different behaviors case by case -
   including recycling, waste reduction, energy and water conservation,
   consumer behavior, and environmental policy support - our data suggest
   no relation between most of the behaviors and economic risk preferences.
   However, economic risk preferences appear to have some relevance for
   travel mode choice and for specific consumer preferences (eco-friendly
   detergents, organic food, and single-use plastics), perhaps because
   people are better able to appreciate aspects of these behaviors related
   to risk (e.g., possibility of traffic accidents, health risks).},

Title = {Developing a model for waste plastic biofuels in CRDi diesel engines
   using FTIR, GCMS, and WASPAS synchronisations for engine analysis},

Abstract = {The excessive use of single-use plastic products in modern life has
   caused severe environmental, social, economic, and health consequences
   globally. Mostly all plastics manufactured are one-time-use materials
   that end up in landfills or as unmanageable garbage. This situation has
   led to the production of around 400 million tonnes of plastic waste per
   year, and if this trend continues, global production will reach up to
   1100 million tonnes by 2050. India alone produced over 34.7 lakh tonnes
   per annum (TPA) of plastic waste, with only half of it being recycled or
   co-processed. As such, there is an urgent need to develop ways to reduce
   plastic waste. One possible solution is the use of waste plastic biofuel
   in engines, which has been shown to have promising results. The study
   aimed to analyse waste plastic oil using (Gas Chromatography Mass
   Spectrometry) GC-MS and (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) FTIR
   analysis to identify its chemical composition. The findings of the study
   revealed the presence of various chemical compounds, such as alcohol,
   hydroperoxide, carbonyl acid groups, ester, carboxylic acid, ketones,
   aldehyde groups, and others. FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of
   alcohol, hydroperoxide, carbonyl acid groups, methyl and methylene
   groups, ester, carboxylic acid, ketones, aldehyde group, symmetric and
   asymmetric C-H bending, C-O stretch for ethers, carboxylic acids, and
   esters, and=C-H bending out for alkenes. The study further explains that
   primary plastic consumption and packaging lifetime have a significant
   impact on plastic waste generation. The research indicates the need to
   explore alternative ways to recycle and dispose of single-use plastics
   to mitigate its negative impact on the environment. Furthermore, this
   study analyses the statistical optimisation method to develop a model
   fit for engine behaviour using waste plastic biofuel on a
   single-cylinder (common rail direct injection engine) CRDi diesel engine
   using the (weighted aggregated sum product assessment) WASPAS approach.
   Additionally, the objective is to develop a model that can optimise the
   engine's performance while using waste plastic biofuel. The uncertainty
   analysis demonstrated that the experiment was carried out with a high
   degree of accuracy and the results were reliable. The study employed the
   WASPAS methodology to evaluate the performance of different (waste
   plastic oil) WPO samples, and the results showed that the optimal
   parametric setting to obtain the desired responses can be achieved with
   a fuel blend of 5\%, load of 21 bar, and speed of 2000 RPM. However, the
   results demonstrate that the use of waste plastic biofuel can
   significantly improve engine performance, and the proposed optimisation
   model can accurately predict the engine's behaviour. The regression
   equation that was formulated showed a reasonable degree of agreement
   between the actual experimental results and the predicted values,
   thereby indicating the reliability of the experiment. Significant
   effects were observed from fuel blend, and speed, whereas load did not
   make a substantial contribution. The findings regarding the effect of
   parameters suggest that a reduction in fuel blend, and engine speed
   resulted in a decline in the performance index, while variations in load
   had little impact. The relationship between load and speed demonstrates
   that a rise in load and a reduction in speed contributed to enhanced
   combustion and a higher performance index.
   The interaction among fuel blend and speed, with a particular emphasis
   on the significance of reduced fuel blend and speed values in order to
   optimise the performance index. The findings of the analysis underlined
   the vitality of process parameters, specifically fuel blend and speed,
   wherein speed exhibited a significant impact on the outcomes. The study
   concludes that the use of waste plastic biofuel in engines can be an
   effective way to reduce plastic waste while improving engine
   performance. This study's findings can be applied to various engines to
   improve their performance while reducing plastic waste. All in all, the
   outcomes of the study make a substantial contribution to the advancement
   of scientific information regarding the properties of waste plastic oil
   as well as its combustion characteristics. This expands the potential
   for advanced breakthrough innovations in sustainable energy solutions
   and the conservation of the environment.},

Abstract = {The Comment by Ojeda and Baciu (2024) on the work by Moreno et al.
   (2023) lacks scientific premise and is mostly not supported by
   peer-reviewed literature. They argue that our study neglected
   fundamental scientific steps, although it is widely known that
   greenwashing practices can be assessed using frameworks based on
   product-label analyses. In addition, the Comment presents a lot of wrong
   or scientifically unsupported information regarding the supposed
   biodegradability of oxo-plastics, overall, in defense of d2w
   masterbatch. Here, it is necessary to point out that such materials have
   been banned in the European Union. Thus, in the `post-truth' era,
   intangible statements like those presented by Ojeda and Baciu, can
   undermine evidence-based decisions. Therefore, the global governance of
   oxo(bio)degradable plastics must be evidence-based.},

Title = {Ecological packaging: Creating sustainable solutions with all-natural
   biodegradable cellulose materials},
Journal = {GIANT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Plastics, accumulating globally as microplastics in living organisms,
   significantly contribute to environmental issues. Current materials like
   polylactic acid and commercial paper face limitations due to inadequate
   heat and water resistance, resulting in various practical
   inconveniences. This study reports a high-strength, water-resistant,
   recyclable, and naturally degradable pure cellulose food packaging
   material, which is crafted from bacterial cellulose (BC) and ethyl
   cellulose (EC) by a straightforward filtration and scratch coating
   process. The use of the EC ethanol solution eliminates the need for
   additional binders. Remarkably, the EC-BC pure cellulose material
   exhibits excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength of 195.3 +/-
   23.2 MPa), a stability in liquid environments (136.9 +/- 24.2 MPa
   mechanical strength after 30 minutes of immersion in water),
   recyclability, natural degradability, costeffectiveness, and
   non-toxicity. These attributes position binder-free hybrid designs,
   based on cellulose structures, as a promising solution to address
   environmental challenges arising from the extensive use of single-use
   plastics.},

Abstract = {Consumer attitudes and behaviour regarding consumption of plastic goods
   and proper waste management are of importance for reducing plastic and
   microplastic (MP) pollution. Therefore, based on Eurobarometer survey,
   this study aims to analyse European attitudes and behaviour related to
   plastic pollution reduction. Europeans acknowledge marine and river
   pollution as important environmental problems and are worried about
   plastics and MP environmental impacts. However, this does not translate
   into related plastic reduction behaviours. Regression analysis show that
   analysed behaviours are likely to be undertaken by women, younger, with
   higher incomes respondents and by those who express higher worry about
   plastic and MP environmental impacts. Industry and big companies are
   seen as having the main role in reducing plastic waste and littering,
   chargers for single use plastics being less important. Respondents also
   stress the role of education. Hence, focus on concrete steps to reduce
   plastic waste, highlighting the interaction of individual actions and
   environment should be given.},

Title = {The end of plastic? The EU's directive on single-use plastics and its
   implementation in Poland},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},

Abstract = {We are drowning in a sea of plastic. Not only do marine animals ingest
   or get entangled in (micro) plastic, but it also ends up in the food
   chain, including in humans. This plastic comes from mainly single-use
   products. ``Directive (EU) 2019/904 of the European Parliament and of
   the Council of 5 June 2019 on the reduction of the impact of certain
   plastic products on the environment{''} introduced numerous restrictions
   on their production. However, its effectiveness depends on national
   implementations that are delayed due to, inter alia, the objections of
   manufacturers. In this article, we present research conducted on Polish
   companies producing single-use plastic products, on sellers (retail
   outlets and food service establishments) and consumers. The results show
   that all study groups agree on the need to reduce the production of
   disposable plastics. The most frequently indicated solution is the
   introduction of reusable products to the market (in line with the
   circular economy notion), which would still be synthetic polymers.
   Manufacturers emphasize that promising chemical recycling technologies
   are emerging for all plastic waste. In addition, both consumers and
   producers are increasingly focused on products made of alternative
   materials, as consumers (especially from large cities) are increasingly
   averse to plastic in general, which was also pointed out by sellers.
   Consumers surveyed believe that the ``Plastics Directive{''} is needed
   and blame the producers of disposable plastics for the condition of the
   environment, while manufacturers highlight irresponsible consumer
   behaviour and the need for more education in this regard.},

Abstract = {The increasing popularity of single-use wet wipes across a variety of
   applications has caused environmental and economic challenges. Due to
   their convenience and low cost, disposable nonwoven wipes have become a
   necessity in the lives of many. However, consumers rarely consider the
   end-of-life of these items. Despite efforts from stakeholders, including
   wipes manufacturers and wastewater experts, there is frequent confusion
   among consumers regarding appropriate disposal. Many consumers flush
   wipes that are not compatible with municipal sewer systems, causing
   considerable damage. Additionally, wipes have poor environmental
   outcomes, as they often contain non-renewable plastics or are unable to
   biodegrade under disposal conditions. Previously, the wet wipes industry
   was projected to grow an average of 6\% between 2021 and 2025; however,
   the use of these disposable items is projected to be much higher due to
   the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper reviews the market, key challenges,
   and technical properties of single-use nonwoven wipes. An emphasis is
   placed on the unique properties and associated challenges of flushable
   wipes. With strong market demands, consumers are unlikely to abandon
   single-use wipes, and therefore innovative solutions are required to
   solve the main environmental and technical challenges associated with
   flushable and non-flushable wipes.},

Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {Plantain peels as agro-waste are generated in the millions of tons per
   year with no profitable management strategies. On the other hand, the
   excessive use of plastic packaging threatens the environment and human
   health. This research aimed to address both problems via a green
   approach. High-quality pectin was recovered from plantain peels via an
   enzyme-assisted and ethanol-recycling process. The yield and
   galacturonic acid (GalA) content of the recovered low methoxy pectin was
   12.43\% and 25.0\%, respectively, when cellulase was added at 50 U per 5
   g peel powder, with a significantly higher recovery rate and purity than
   the pectin products extracted with no cellulase (P <= 0.05). The
   recovered pectin was further integrated and reinforced with beeswax
   solid-lipid nanoparticles (BSLNs) to fabricate films as a potential
   alternative packaging material to single-use plastics. The reinforced
   pectin films showed improved light barrier, water resistance,
   mechanical, conformational, and morphological properties. This study
   presents a sustainable strategy to transform plantain peels into pectin
   products and pectin-based packaging films with broad applications.},

Abstract = {This study analysed the possibilities of developing biocomposites using
   a combination of poly lactic acid and polybutylene adipate terephthalate
   combined with micro cellulose from four different agricultural residues
   (banana pseudo stem, screw pine, pineapple leaf, and water hyacinth) in
   various combinations to produce biodegradable kitchenware suitable for
   food serving, consumption and other culinary applications. Tensile
   strength of developed composites varied between 14 and 18 MPa.
   Crystallinity of the samples varied between 26 \% and 50 \%. Contact
   angle results (47-83 degrees) exposed the hydrophilic nature of the
   developed biocomposite. The results were analysed to optimise the mould
   and injection moulding procedure parameters. The analysis of the
   developed kitchenware indicated minimal water absorption and leaching,
   suitable for culinary application. Biodegradability tests indicated
   complete degradation of samples within 80 days. All samples indicated
   comparable results, with pineapple leaf-based samples exhibiting better
   characteristics. The experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of
   developed kitchenware as an effective solution for the present
   environmental issues caused by the disposal of single-use
   non-biodegradable plastic-based kitchenware.},

Title = {Microwave-assisted depolymerization of PET over heterogeneous catalysts},
Journal = {CATALYSIS TODAY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {418},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {The accumulation of plastic waste in the environment is rising and poses
   a significant environmental and health threat. Polyethylene
   terephthalate (PET), used mainly in single-use plastic bottles, accounts
   for a substantial fraction of this waste. The currently employed
   recycling strategies are inadequate to deal with the global plastic
   waste problem. PET glycolysis is a promising depolymerization method but
   has mainly been conducted using homogeneous catalysts; developing active
   and sustainable catalysts, and more energy-efficient processes remain
   challenges. Here, we implement microwave heating in PET glycolysis and
   identify ZnO as an excellent heterogeneous catalyst. We demonstrate the
   influence of ZnO's particle size and facet and hydrogen bonding on its
   activity. Finally, we demonstrate excellent performance for real-world
   post-consumer PET waste deconstruction with rapid depolymerization into
   bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), achieving > 95\% yields in
   less than 10 min. Cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment also indicates
   that BHET produced by ZnO-catalyzed glycolysis has lower global warming
   potential than the petrochemical-based production and
   homogeneously-catalyzed glycolysis.},

Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {204},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The rise of plastics in the 20th century revolutionized modern life but
   inadvertently exacerbated the marine litter crisis. The proliferation of
   wastes such as single-use plastics has escalated pollution along the
   coastline, demanding coordinated, decisive, and unified action. While
   the absence of specific national marine litter policies is concerning,
   there is growing recognition of urgency to address this issue. A group
   of experts and stakeholders was involved through a multi-staged workshop
   to assess the generated information based on scientific evidence and
   formulate a framework for the National Marine Litter Policy (NMLP). This
   paper proposes policy options (4 targets \& 20 strategies) to address
   marine litter pollution, especially plastics, and aims to elucidate the
   urgency and significance of implementing an NMLP as a comprehensive
   strategy to combat plastics pollution. Implementing dedicated policies
   and action plans tailored to the unique challenges faced by each country
   is a vital step towards sustainable oceans.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {5},
Month = {DEC 10},
Abstract = {This study critically examines the socio-economic impacts and practical
   challenges of implementing plastic policies and regulations such as bans
   in Caribbean small island developing states (SIDS), within the broader
   context of global environmental efforts. By employing a mixed-methods
   approach, the research uses qualitative data from expert interviews from
   the Windward Islands in the south-east of the Caribbean, and on the
   ground observations and documentation of plastic and alternative usage
   in the island of Grenada. The findings highlight a significant ``plastic
   policy hypocrisy,{''} where bans on single-use plastics exist alongside
   a heavy reliance on imported goods predominantly packaged in plastic.
   This contradiction points to a broader issue in environmental
   policymaking, where surface-level solutions like bans are employed
   without addressing underlying systemic challenges, such as inadequate
   recycling infrastructure or lack of export opportunities for recyclable
   materials. The research highlights how these policies, though
   well-intentioned, may fall short in practicality and global alignment.
   The study highlights the need for holistic, globally informed, and
   context-sensitive approaches to marine environmental related policies in
   Caribbean SIDS. Emphasizing the integration of ecological, economic, and
   cultural dimensions, it advocates for regional and international
   collaboration to enhance marine litter specifically plastic policy
   development and technical expertise.},

Title = {What not to do with dog poop},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {896},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {This short communication paper comments on the controversial but highly
   unpleasant topic of littered plastic dog waste bags in the environment.
   Littered plastic dog waste bags are a source of plastic and microplastic
   pollution and dog faeces contained in these littered bags also pose
   human and ecological health risks. This short communication suggests
   that this littering may be occurring due to confusion by pet owners, who
   may believe that these so called `biodegradable' bags are compositable,
   which in the absence of industrial composting facilities, are not. Thus,
   plastic dog waste bags continue to be a source of plastic and
   microplastic pollution in the environment long after they have been
   littered. All pet owners should deposit plastic dog poop bags in
   appropriate waste bins, not in the environment.},

   for green policies in marinas},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {419},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {`Going green' is still challenging in the yachting industry partly due
   to the lack of consumer-centric approaches. This study assesses sailors'
   preferences and willingness to pay for green policies in marinas, in the
   context of other measures to increase health security and digital
   transformation. To do so, a choice experiment was designed through the
   lens of stakeholders and supported by the Delphi technique. The study is
   based on the marinas of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic crossing and
   involved European sailors as potential users. Data confirm that sailors'
   utility and intention to visit marinas increase the most when ambitious
   green programs are in place, thereby confirming a high environmental
   sensitivity among them. More specifically, solar energy use, single-use
   plastic eradication, and waste recycling are the programs with the
   greatest positive impact on sailors' willingness to pay. This indicates
   a potential profitability and market opportunities derived from more
   envi-ronmental friendly practices in marinas. The study opens a new
   perspective to improve incentive and funding schemes and close
   implementation gaps in recreational ports.},

Abstract = {Plastic materials are increasingly present in our lives. It is estimated
   that more than 360 million tonnes of plastics are produced annually
   worldwide. Particularly, single-use plastics represent an important
   segment in plastic production. In this context, plastic contamination,
   and consequently microplastic release, has become a growing concern for
   aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the effects of
   exposure to polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microplastics (<32 mu m) on
   Chironomus sancticaroli larvae. The larvae were exposed to different
   concentrations of PET particles (0 (control group), 500, and 5,000
   particles.kg(-1) of dry sediment) for 10 days. Our results demonstrated
   that C. sancticaroli larvae displayed PET microplastics in their
   digestive tracts, and the ingestion increased with increasing PET
   concentrations. Plastic particles in the digestive tract can reduce the
   energy obtained by larvae feeding and, consequently, impair their
   development. The adult emergence rate displayed a significant decrease
   observed at the highest PET concentration compared with the control
   group. These findings reinforce existing concerns that microplastics, at
   concentrations currently found in the natural freshwater environments,
   can impact the development of benthic macroinvertebrates and,
   consequently, result in an unbalance in the freshwater ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Biodegradable polymers have shown enormous potential for application in
   food packaging systems and offer solutions to mitigate the challenges of
   single-use plastics. Over the past decade, advances in fermentation
   technology, metabolic engineering of microorganisms, and synthetic
   biology have enabled the optimization and functionalization of
   biodegradable polymers for food packaging application. This article
   provides an overview of the biotechnological approaches/methods used in
   advancing the production of biopolymers and summarizes the recent
   developments in the application of functionalized biopolymers for
   decision-making and quality control. It discusses the current
   applications and future perspectives of extracellular biopolymers in
   food systems. Finally, this review highlights the complexities of public
   acceptance, safety, and government regulations and legislations.},

Abstract = {Microplastic (MPs) pollution has become a global environmental concern
   with significant impacts on ecosystems and human health. Although MPs
   have been widely detected in aquatic environments, their presence in
   terrestrial ecosystems remains largely unexplored. This review examines
   the multifaceted issues of MPs pollution in terrestrial ecosystem,
   covering various aspects from additives in plastics to global
   legislation and sustainable solutions. The study explores the widespread
   distribution of MPs worldwide and their potential antagonistic
   interactions with co-occurring contaminants, emphasizing the need for a
   holistic understanding of their environmental implications. The
   influence of MPs on soil and plants is discussed, shedding light on the
   potential consequences for terrestrial ecosystems and agricultural
   productivity. The aging mechanisms of MPs, including photo and thermal
   aging, are elucidated, along with the factors influencing their aging
   process. Furthermore, the review provides an overview of global
   legislation addressing plastic waste, including bans on specific plastic
   items and levies on single-use plastics. Sustainable solutions for MPs
   pollution are proposed, encompassing},

Abstract = {Single-use plastics are a major threat to the environment and human
   health. Prioritizing sustainable and naturederived biodegradable
   materials to develop edible films and coatings for food products is the
   current focus in packaging applications. Among such biodegradable
   polymers, gums obtained from plant seeds (e.g., guar and tara), plant
   exudates (e.g., Arabic and karaya), tubers (e.g., konjac and salep), or
   modern biotechnological approaches (e.g., xanthan and gellan) are
   important ones, and they have been the subject of recent interest in
   developing edible films and coatings. Because of the highly branched
   nature of the polymer network and their affinity for water molecules,
   the gum-based films have low mechanical strength and poor resistance to
   water vapor permeability. With a goal to improve the thermal,
   mechanical, and barrier properties of gum-based films, this review
   discusses the approaches to property improvement currently used,
   including plasticization, blending, and the addition of active compounds
   and nanoparticles.},

Title = {Potential threat of microplastics to humans: toxicity prediction
   modeling by small data analysis},

Abstract = {Microplastics are ubiquitous in the environment and continuously
   interact with humans. Increased plastic production and consumption cause
   severe plastic pollution, emerging as a global problem. Accordingly,
   research on the impact of microplastics on humans has been exponentially
   increasing. However, microplastics are blended and entangled with
   various types, sizes, and shapes in nature, which is still a limitation
   to understanding the threat of microplastics to humans by studying
   single-use plastic. To reflect microplastics in nature, we present a new
   predictive model to investigate the toxicity of mixed microplastics to
   human cells. We statistically analyzed a small toxicity data set
   according to the mixing ratio of three different types of microplastics:
   polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and acrylonitrile butadiene
   styrene (ABS). Using the model, we could successively predict the
   toxicity of a wide range of mixing ratios with a reliable prediction
   performance. Also, the toxicity is highly dependent on the number of
   plastics rather than hydrophobicity, functional groups, and surface
   roughness. We strongly believe that this model design offers prospects
   for a new platform to realistically predict the toxicity of
   microplastics to humans.},

   adoption using agent-based modeling},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS},

Abstract = {Single-use plastic water bottles are ubiquitous in daily life. Most
   commonly these bottles are made from petroleum-based plastics, in
   particular polyethylene terephthalate (PET). However, conventional
   plastic water bottles result in substantial environmental pollution and
   plastic waste. Innovative technologies that utilize captured carbon as
   raw materials for producing bioplastic water bottles offer the potential
   to mitigate at least some environmental impacts. Understanding the
   factors that influence consumer adoption of sustainable alternatives is
   essential. This study utilizes Agent Based Modeling (ABM)to investigate
   the adoption dynamics of bioplastic water bottles, analyzing the
   influence of individual behaviors and social interactions within
   consumer networks. The findings demonstrate that the cost is a
   significant factor influencing the adoption rate, while environmental
   benefits motivate some consumers to select bioplastic water bottles over
   conventional ones. Moreover, the results emphasize the importance of
   social networks, indicating that close connections among consumers lead
   to quicker and more widespread adoption due to peer influence},

Title = {Accumulation and exposure classifications of plastics in the different
   coastal habitats in the western Philippine archipelago},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {337},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Studies consistently ranked the Philippines as one of the top
   contributors of plastic wastes leaking into the ocean. However, most of
   these were based on probabilities and estimates due to lack of
   comprehensive ground-truth data, resulting also in the limited
   understanding of the contributing factors and drivers of local
   pollution. This makes it challenging to develop science-driven and
   locally-contextualized policies and interventions to mitigate the
   problem. Here, 56 sites from different coastal habitats in the western
   Philippine archipelago were surveyed for macroplastics standing stock,
   representing geographic regions with varying demography and economic
   activities. Clustering of sites revealed three potential influencing
   factors to plastic accumulation: population density, wind and oceanic
   transport, and habitat type. Notably, the amount and types of dominant
   plastics per geographic region varied significantly. Single-use plastics
   (food packaging and sachets) were the most abundant in sites adjacent to
   densely populated and highly urbanized areas (Manila Bay and eastern
   Palawan), while fishing-related materials dominated in less populated
   and fishing-dominated communities (western Palawan and Bolinao),
   suggesting the local industries significantly contributing to the
   mismanaged plastics in the surveyed sites. Meanwhile, isolated areas
   such as islands were characterized by the abundance of buoyant materials
   (drinking bottles and hygiene product containers), emphasizing the role
   of oceanic transport and strong connectivity in the oceans. Exposure
   assessment also identified single-use and fishing-related plastics to be
   of ``high exposure (Type 4){''} due to their high abundance and high
   occurrence. These increase their chances of encountering and interacting
   with organisms and habitats, thus, resulting into more potential harm.
   This study is the first comprehensive work done in western Philippines,
   and results will help contextualize local pollution, facilitating more
   effective management and policymaking.},

Abstract = {This article explores the advancements in biodegradable food packaging
   materials derived from wheat. Wheat, a predominant global cereal crop,
   offers a sustainable alternative to conventional single-use plastics
   through its starch, gluten, and fiber components. This study highlights
   the fabrication processes of wheat-based materials, including solvent
   casting and extrusion, and their applications in enhancing the shelf
   life and quality of packaged foods. Recent innovations demonstrate
   effectiveness in maintaining food quality, controlling moisture content,
   and providing microbiological protection. Despite the promising
   potential, challenges such as moisture content and interfacial adhesion
   in composites remain. This review concludes with an emphasis on the
   environmental benefits and future trends in wheat-based packaging
   materials.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastics make up 60-95 \% of marine plastic pollution,
   including common commodity films used for packaging and bags. Plastic
   film breaks down as a function of environmental variables like wave
   action, wind, temperature, and UV radiation. Here, we focus on how films
   degrade in cold waters across depths, time, and simulated mammal
   digestion. Five types of single-use film plastics (HDPE thin \& thick,
   LDPE, PP, PE) were weathered for eight months in temperate waters at
   surface and depth in the Salish Sea, WA, USA, and subsequently exposed
   to a laboratory-simulated gray whale stomach. None of the types of
   plastics examined here fully degraded during the course of this 8 months
   study. Weathering time and depth significantly impacted many of the
   physical attributes of plastics, while exposure to a simulated whale gut
   did not. If unable to degrade plastics through digestion, whales risk
   long-term exposure to physical and chemical attributes of plastics.},

Abstract = {The plastics industry has revolutionized several sectors, from packaging
   to automotive, enabling companies to develop innovative products and
   enhance their economic competitiveness. However, the exponential growth
   of this industry has also resulted in a concerning increase in plastic
   waste, leading to environmental repercussions such as microplastic
   contamination, marine pollution and plastic landfills. Therefore,
   researchers, governments, and industrial stakeholders are starting to
   work collaboratively to address this sustainability issue by adopting a
   life cycle perspective. Nevertheless, plastic waste generation is not
   slowing down, and waste management strategies, along with other actions
   across the value chain, need to be improved. While limiting single-use
   plastics and promoting sustainable consumer practices is crucial, these
   measures alone may not be sufficient. Figuring out how to maximize
   products and materials' lifespan by exploring circular economy
   opportunities is just as important as minimizing global consumption.
   This research explores the challenges and opportunities faced by the
   plastics industry and draws a prototype roadmap to identify sustainable
   business opportunities and routes of implementation. It builds on
   previous works on sustainable value roadmapping by defining a vision,
   identifying drives, highlighting business opportunities and discussing
   enablers. Results systematize and expand opportunities and challenges
   identified in scientific literature and industrial reports whilst
   clearly outlining a vision. (c) 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {The Adherence and Outcomes Benefits of Using a Connected, Reusable
   Auto-Injector for Self-Injecting Biologics: A Narrative Review},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN THERAPY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {40},
Number = {11},
Pages = {4758-4776},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Many biologics are now self-administered by patients at home. A variety
   of self-injection devices are available, including vials and syringes,
   prefilled syringes, and spring-driven prefilled pens or auto-injectors.
   Each has advantages and drawbacks, and different devices suit different
   patients. For example, some patients have difficulty achieving
   consistent and successful self-injection due to poor manual dexterity,
   or experience anxiety at the prospect of self-injection or
   injection-site pain. These factors can reduce patients' medication
   adherence and overall experience. Furthermore, while self-injection
   brings patients many benefits, the proliferation of single-use injection
   devices has implications for environmental sustainability, including the
   reliance on single-use plastics, repeated freighting requirements, and
   need for incineration as hazardous waste. Recently developed, innovative
   electromechanical auto-injector devices offer technological enhancements
   over existing devices to overcome some of these issues. Features include
   customisable injection speeds or durations, consistent rate of
   injection, electronic injection logs and reminders, and step-by-step,
   real-time instructions. Indeed, a growing body of evidence points to
   higher adherence rates among patients using electromechanical devices
   compared with other devices. Further, with time, the reusability of
   electromechanical devices may prove to lighten the environmental impact
   compared with disposable devices, especially as research continues to
   optimise their sustainability, driven by increased consumer demands for
   environmental responsibility. This narrative review discusses the
   differences between prefilled syringes, spring-driven prefilled pens,
   and electromechanical devices. It also explores how these features may
   help reduce injection-associated pain and anxiety, improve patient
   experience, connectivity and adherence, and drive sustainability of
   biologic drugs in future.
   Biologics are a type of medicine becoming widespread in the treatment of
   many diverse diseases. Biologics are injected under the skin and can
   sometimes be injected by patients themselves at home. Many injection
   devices are available to help patients with this self-injection, and
   fall into three broad categories: prefilled syringes, prefilled pens,
   and electromechanical devices. Each has its own advantages and
   disadvantages, and different devices suit different patients. For
   example, some patients have difficulty achieving consistent and
   successful self-injection because of limited hand movement or become
   anxious at the prospect of self-injection or injection-site pain. These
   factors can reduce patients' ability and willingness to take medication
   as prescribed and may worsen their overall experience. Further, many
   disposable devices involve single-use plastics and may pose an
   environmental toll. Reusable electromechanical devices are the newest of
   the available devices and offer enhanced features over some earlier
   devices. These include customisable injection speeds or durations,
   consistent rates of injection, electronic injection logs, reminders, and
   real-time instructions. Evidence suggests that patients using
   electromechanical devices may have higher rates of adherence (i.e. more
   patients take their medication as prescribed) than those using other
   devices. Additionally, with time and further research, the reusability
   of electromechanical devices may prove to lighten the environmental
   impact compared with disposable devices. Here we discuss the differences
   between prefilled pens, prefilled syringes, and electromechanical
   devices, and explore the features that may help reduce
   injection-associated pain and anxiety, improve patient experience,
   connectivity, and adherence, and drive greater sustainability.},

Abstract = {BackgroundCommercial cigarette filters are single-use plastics and the
   main component of cigarette butts, the most common trash item collected
   worldwide. Governments bear the economic burden of managing the waste
   and the environmental pollution due to discarded filters and packages.
   Using available data sources, we estimate the economic burden of plastic
   tobacco waste on country economic groups.MethodsWe reviewed available
   public data sources that could inform estimates of the economic
   environmental burden of butt waste for countries. We estimated total
   weight of plastic cigarette filters and packaging based on cigarette
   consumption and applied World Bank waste management cost estimates per
   ton to this total. We then applied estimates of ecosystem losses per ton
   of plastic waste provided by the World Wildlife Fund to establish losses
   attributable to tobacco's plastics.ResultsWe estimate that US\$25.7
   billion is lost annually (waste management and marine ecosystem service
   losses) due to cigarette plastic sources. We estimate US\$186 billion in
   such losses over a 10-year period, adjusted for inflation. Countries are
   making progress in developing plastics policies, particularly banning
   single-use ones, but the costs of tobacco's plastic pollution are
   overlooked.ConclusionEfforts to reduce plastic pollution should address
   cigarette filters as toxic, widespread and preventable sources of marine
   pollution. Countries may develop specific estimates of waste management
   and ecosystem costs in order to assign tobacco industry accountability
   for this pollution. These results indicate minimum estimates for a
   majority of countries.},

Abstract = {The Philippines ranks as the world's third-largest plastic polluter, a
   consequence of widespread consumerism and lack of funding and initiative
   by succeeding presidents in the establishment of new waste management
   policies. Sachet plastic, sold in ``sari-sari{''} stores due to its
   economic appeal and deep-rooted presence in Filipino culture,
   exacerbates the issue. The government established Material Recovery
   Facilities (MRFs) for waste sorting and recycling to address waste
   issues. However, most MRFs struggle to recycle sachet plastic due to its
   complex composition, being made of polymers, metals, and paper. In
   addition to MRFs, informal businesses called ``Junk shops{''} play a
   vital role in plastic collection, though they choose to avoid sachets
   due to their low economic value. Unfortunately, sachets not collected by
   MRFs or junk shops along the plastic stream end up in landfills and
   dumpsites, posing health risks, particularly for low-income Filipino
   communities. This article delves into the life cycle of sachet plastic,
   from manufacturing to its environmental impact, shedding light on the
   challenges and implications for Filipino society. We also expand on
   potential solutions and future outcomes that can act as a beacon of hope
   for the Philippines.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {FEB 23},
Abstract = {Microplastic pollution is ubiquitous, with textiles being a major source
   of one of the dominant microplastic types-microfibres. Microfibres have
   been discovered in the aquatic environment and marine biota,
   demonstrating direct infiltration in the environment. However, the
   impact of non-plastic microfibres has been overlooked until recently
   despite their prevalence and the ecotoxicological risk posed by chemical
   dyes and finishes used during processing. During an expedition from Lamu
   to Zanzibar (East Africa), a citizen science strategy was employed to
   innovate, educate and influence microfibre pollution reform through the
   Flipflopi project, a circular economy effort to stop the use of
   single-use plastic. Simple sampling methods were developed to replace
   costly equipment, which local citizens could use to partake in the
   collection and sampling of surface water samples from the previously
   understudied Kenyan and Tanzanian coast. To maintain the reliability of
   samples and to minimise contamination, a forensic science strategy was
   embedded throughout the methodology of the study, collection and
   analysis of the samples. A total of 2,403 microfibres from 37 sites were
   recovered and fully characterised with 55\% found to be of natural
   origin, 8\% regenerated cellulosic and 37\% synthetic microfibres.
   Natural microfibres were in higher abundance in 33 of the 37 sampled
   sites. Congruent with recent studies, these findings further support the
   need for greater understanding of the anthropogenic impact of natural
   microfibres.},

   hotels-Would an initiative solve this problem or does it need a law?},

Abstract = {This paper examines the environmental effects of polyethylene
   terephthalate (PET) water bottles used by tourists in Dubai.
   Unfortunately, tourists residing in Dubai hotels must depend on these
   single-use plastic water bottles that have negative environmental
   impacts associated with their production and disposal. Thus, the
   government of Dubai launched an initiative to reduce the usage of PET
   bottles, and this paper discusses whether this initiative is adequate to
   change hotels' dependence on PET water bottles. Therefore, this paper
   tries first to find the reasons that would drive hotels to comply with
   this initiative and then assesses the compliance of hotels with this
   initiative 1 year after its launch. It is found that pressures from
   hotels with the same and higher ratings are crucial drivers for hotels
   to replace PET bottles with other alternatives. Officials affiliated
   with the Dubai Can initiative confirmed these findings. They have also
   anticipated that UAE residents who spend their vacations in Dubai hotels
   will exert substantial pressure on hotels to abandon PET bottle use.
   Decision-makers affirmed that a good percentage of five-star hotels, in
   addition to several four-star hotels, have abolished the use of PET
   bottles. Moreover, it is anticipated that all hotels are expected to
   stop using PET bottles. Consequently, this study shows that promoting
   environmentally responsible behavior without enacting laws is possible.},

Journal = {ISCIENCE},

Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {Generation of voluminous single -use plastic waste and byproducts from
   agricultural harvests such as rice straws (RSs) are major global
   challenges due to their disposal issues, contributing to greenhouse gas
   emissions, and affecting the ecological system with threats to human
   health. A scalable, low-cost, and ecofriendly strategy for fabricating
   cellulose -silica -based drinking straws, free from microplastics and
   adhesive, through strategic valorization of RS is reported.
   Functionalization by delignification- cum- crosslinking of RS leads to
   development of straws with high water stability ( similar to 5 days),
   solvothermal stability (0 degrees C- 95 degrees C), tensile strength
   (128 MPa), low migration values (<60 mg/kg), improved biodegradability (
   similar to 126 days) with reduced wettability and hydrophobicity. RS
   drinking straws show antibacterial, selfcleaning, self -healing, anti
   -fizzing, reusable, and generate significantly lower carbon footprint
   (<99.8\% and <53.34\% global warming potential than metal and polylactic
   acid straws). Repurposing of agrowastes from farms to commercially
   viable drinking straws which biodegrades after its consumption achieves
   the goal of circular economy and sustainable development.},

Abstract = {In 2019, the United States consumed over 57 million metric tons (MMT) of
   plastic with less than 7\% recovered for reuse. This study provides an
   updated material flow analysis at national and regional scales for all
   durable and single-use plastics in the United States. From this material
   flow analysis, we develop a series of alternative future national
   plastic flow scenarios that envision a scale-up of recycling
   technologies, incorporating technical limitations and sorting
   infrastructure constraints. The results suggest that a maximum of 68\%
   (24 MMT) of plastic waste could be diverted from landfills by scaling up
   existing commercial recycling technologies. Based on the current
   technological landscape, reaching near-zero waste is only possible if
   processes that are operating at pilot and laboratory scales can be
   effectively scaled and coupled with improved sorting infrastructure.
   Through these scenarios with increased recycling, the availability of
   postconsumer resin stocks could increase by 22-43 MMT.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a shift in global thinking and
   brought about new and specific behavioural patterns worldwide. The
   pandemic period was largely focused on the global health crisis, leading
   to the neglect of certain pre -pandemic circular values. In prioritizing
   the health of their citizens, many countries and governments reverted to
   linear economies. Furthermore, the world population witnessed a rapid
   increase in the consumption of certain pharmaceuticals, an
   (over)emphasis on personal hygiene and the use of disinfectants, and a
   surge in the demand for disposable plastics due to reduced human
   contact. While some industries experienced temporary shutdowns, others
   operated with increased intensity. Overcrowding in healthcare facilities
   coupled with inadequate disposal of medical waste and hospital
   wastewater, has inflicted a specific blow to global ecosystems.
   Consequently, an unexpectedly large quantity of various pharmaceuticals,
   personal care products, single -use plastics, personal protective
   equipment, and hazardous and non -hazardous medical waste has found its
   way into the environment. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the
   broader environmental consequences of pandemic -related behaviour and
   devise suitable solutions to prevent and reduce pandemic -induced
   environmental pollution. Certain pandemic -related behaviours need
   changing, existing damage requires remediation, and global production
   should be directed toward newer and more sustainable technologies. This
   paper provides a brief overview of the consequences of the global health
   crisis on the biosphere, and outlines perspectives for addressing
   encountered problems and mitigating future disasters.},

Journal = {GEOFORUM},

Abstract = {Given the global environmental impacts associated with single-use
   plastics, alternatives are being considered, including the reuse of
   product packaging, which aim to retain the functionality of products
   while reducing waste and broader environmental impacts. Drawing on the
   Multi-Level Perspective approach, we analyse three national examples of
   reuse in Denmark, Germany, and Mexico. While the success of reuse
   initiatives is often attributed to heightened levels of environmental
   consciousness, we argue that understanding national variations in levels
   of reuse requires greater attention to the commercial drivers,
   regulatory factors, and provisioning systems in which they arise. This
   argument is developed through case studies of the beverage sector in the
   three national contexts - specifically beer, mineral water, and soft
   drinks - as this sector is often regarded as a successful illustration
   of business-to-consumer reuse systems. To conclude, we consider what the
   implications might be for nations such as the UK where reuse levels
   remain comparatively low.},

Abstract = {The versatility of plastic products results from additives,
   plasticizers, and chemicals that are included to obtain desired
   qualities. Research shows that these chemicals can leach from the
   plastic product throughout the lifecycle and cause negative effects to
   consumers and the environment. Health effects of these chemicals range
   from endocrine disrupters to carcinogens, yet the fate of these
   chemicals is still not well understood. When considering the healthcare
   sector's reliance on single-use plastics, the concern of leaching
   chemicals to vulnerable groups of patients becomes high. Furthermore,
   it's paramount to consider the substitution of these chemicals to ensure
   nonhazardous circularity and or recyclability of materials. Findings
   from this review suggest that while health effects of plastic associated
   chemicals addressed in this review are well studied, the implications of
   these chemicals on the circularity of materials are novel and must be
   considered in product design, within compre-hensive regulations, and by
   healthcare facilities.},

Abstract = {Plastic products in plant production and protection help farmers
   increase crop production, enhance food quality, and reduce global water
   use and their environmental footprint. Simultaneously, plastic has
   emerged as a critical ecological issue in recent years, and its
   pollution has significantly impacted soil, water, and plants. Thus, this
   review examines the multifaceted problems of plastic pollution in
   agriculture as a risk to food security, the ecosystem, and the
   environment. The study's objective was to review and present the most
   recent information on using different plastic products in agriculture,
   the sources of plastic pollution, the advantages and drawbacks of using
   plastic products, and the strategies for mitigating plastic pollution in
   agriculture. Furthermore, after examining current plastic applications,
   benefits, adverse effects, and risks to soil, plants, and the
   environment, we addressed the requirements for technological
   advancements, regulations, and social processes that could contribute to
   mitigating plastic pollution in our ecosystems. We identified different
   pathways toward more sustainable use of plastics in agriculture and
   discussed future research directions.},

Title = {Upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic wastes into
   carbon-based nanomaterials: Current status and future perspectives},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {215},
Month = {JUL 17},
Abstract = {To date, the prevalence of commonly used plastics like Polyethylene
   terephthalate (PET), polylactic acid (PLA), and polybutylene
   terephthalate (PBT) extends across diverse industries, from textiles to
   beverage bottles and daily packaging applications. Originally designed
   for up to 50 years of durable shelf life, these plastics face
   accelerated disposal challenges due to the pervasive ``throw-away ``
   culture. The rapid expansion of single-use plastic manufacturing,
   notably PET, has led to an astonishing global output of one million tons
   of plastic each year, highlighting the urgent requirement for efficient
   solutions in managing plastic waste. Carbon-based nanomaterials derived
   from PET are synthesized using chemical reactions in solution or
   high-temperature environments. This review discusses molten salt,
   hydrothermal, and one-step solvent-based synthesis techniques. We
   investigate advances in converting PET plastic into nanostructured
   materials, revealing their potential for energy storage, adsorption,
   supercapacitors, and sensors. As we navigate the challenges of plastic
   waste, this review scrutinizes the environmental impact by bridging the
   gap between plastic pollution and the utilization of upcycled
   nanomaterials of these pioneering methods, offering insights into their
   sustainability.},

Abstract = {Globally, the demand for single-use plastics has increased due to the
   rising demand for food delivery and household goods. This has led to
   environmental challenges caused by indiscriminate dumping and disposal.
   To address this issue, non-degradable plastics are being replaced with
   biodegradable alternatives. Polylactic acid (PLA) is a type of
   biodegradable plastic that has excellent mechanical properties. However,
   its applications are limited due to its low crystallinity and
   brittleness. Studies have been conducted to combat these limitations
   using carbon or inorganic nucleating agents. In this study, waste cement
   and PLA were mixed to investigate the effect of the hybrid inorganic
   nucleating agent on the crystallinity and mechanical properties of PLA.
   Waste cement accelerated the lamellar growth of PLA and improved its
   crystallinity. The results indicate that the flexural and impact
   strengths increased by approximately 3.63\% and 76.18\%, respectively.},

Abstract = {Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a widely used polymer in the
   production of single-use plastics, is a significant contributor to the
   global plastic pollution problem. This work explores the synergistic
   effects between clay matrices and active Nb2O5 catalytic species,
   emphasizing the enhanced catalytic performance for the aminolytic
   depolymerization of PET and polyester (PES) wastes. The materials were
   well characterized using XRD, SEMEDS, FTIR, and UV-DRS studies. The
   surface parameters of Nb2O5 were enhanced by forming a composite with
   kaolin, which is confirmed by BET isotherms. Kaolin provides a large
   surface area, which enhances the dispersion and interaction of the
   niobia catalyst. The combination of kaolin and niobia acts as an
   effective catalyst for the depolymerization of PET, breaking down the
   polymer into its monomeric constituents. The catalytic efficiency of
   Nb2O5 (82 \%) has been enhanced in the presence of kaolin support (95
   \%), forming depolymerized bis(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalamide (BHETA)
   and excellent reusability and stability of up to five subsequent cycles
   thereby emphasizing their potential for sustained performance in
   industrial applications and contributing to the ongoing discourse on
   advancing catalyst technologies for enhanced environmental impact in the
   circular economy.},

Abstract = {In this article, I synthesise three literatures that-whilst having
   significant overlap, are largely not in conversation with one another:
   social movement theory on the `religion-like' characteristics of social
   movements (particularly environmentalism); work by scholars in religious
   studies tracing the religious roots and contemporary spiritual aspects
   of environmental movements; and the emerging literature on the contours
   of nonreligious belief and practice in contemporary societies-especially
   as they relate to nature. Using these literatures, I show how
   environmentalisms articulate a `cosmology' or world-view that gives
   meaning to the world, imbues ethical meaning to material objects like
   single-use plastics and their reusable alternatives, and is trans-lated
   into everyday practices that attempt to remoralise activists'
   relationship with the natural world. The article responds to a call by
   scholars of nonre-ligion to pay greater attention to `lived'
   nonreligion, and in particular, how nonreligious worldviews translate
   into `world-repairing' forms of social and political action. I argue
   that social movements are rich sites for the study of lived nonreligion,
   as they offer their participants space for the cultivation, expression,
   and embodiment of `moral visions'.},

   Organisation.Design/methodology/approachAn emergent case study approach
   using multiple sources of data developed an in-depth, multifaceted,
   real-world context evaluation of the intervention. The methodology draws
   on citizen science ``messy{''} data collection involving multiple,
   fragmented sources.FindingsMoving from single-use cups to reusables
   requires collective commitment by retailers, consumers and policymakers,
   despite the many incentives and penalties applied to incentivise
   behaviour change. Difficult post-COVID economics, austerity and
   infrastructure gaps are undermining both reusable acceptance and interim
   solutions to our dependence upon disposables.Research
   limitations/implicationsAlthough the non-traditional methodology
   rendered gaps and omissions in the data, the citizen science was
   democratising and inclusive for the community.Practical implicationsOur
   practical contribution evaluates a whole community intervention setting
   to encourage reusable cups, integrating multiple stakeholders, in a
   non-controllable, non-experimental environment in contrast to previous
   research. This paper demonstrates how small community grants can foster
   impactful collaborative partnerships between an SPO and researchers,
   facilitate knowledge-exchange beyond the initial remit and provide a
   catalyst for possible future impact and outcomes.Originality/valueTo
   assess the impact at both the outcome and the process level of the
   intervention, we use Pawson and Tilley's realist evaluation theory - the
   Context Mechanism Outcome framework. The methodological contribution
   demonstrates the process of citizen science ``messy{''} data collection,
   likely to feature more frequently in future social science research
   addressing climate change and sustainability challenges.},

Abstract = {In the face of escalating environmental concerns, particularly the
   pervasive issue of non-biodegradable fast-food packaging waste, this
   study introduces a ground-breaking solution that not only addresses
   waste management but also advances biomedical technology. Utilizing the
   underexploited resource of Fucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide from
   brown algae, we have innovatively transformed fast-food packaging waste
   into eco-friendly fluorescent carbon dots (FPCDs). These FPCDs were
   meticulously characterized through advanced techniques like FT-IR, TEM,
   and XRD, shedding light on their unique structure, morphology, and
   composition. A significant discovery of this study is the potent
   antimicrobial properties of these FPCDs, which demonstrate remarkable
   effectiveness against specific bacterial and fungal strains. This opens
   new avenues in the realm of biomedical applications, including imaging,
   drug delivery, and biosensing. Furthermore, extensive toxicity
   assessments, including the Brine shrimp lethality assay and Adult
   Artemia toxicity tests, underscore the safety of these nanoparticles,
   bolstering their applicability in sensitive medical scenarios. Our
   research presents a compelling dual approach, ingeniously tackling
   environmental sustainability issues by repurposing waste while
   simultaneously creating valuable materials for biomedical use. This dual
   benefit underscores the transformative potential of our approach,
   setting a precedent in both waste management and medical innovation.},

Title = {Effectiveness of Jute Cellulose Nanocrystal Reinforcement into
   Biodegradable Packaging ``Sonali Bags®{''}},
Journal = {GREEN MATERIALS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 20},
Abstract = {In an age marked by environmental consciousness, ``Sonali Bags (R){''}
   have emerged as promising substitutes for single-use plastic bags,
   invented in Bangladesh. It is a jute cellulose-based, totally
   biodegradable, compostable, recyclable, and environment-friendly
   biopolymer. However, certain physical limitations have hindered its
   widespread consumer appeal. To address these challenges, this study
   pioneers the integration of Jute Cellulose Nano-crystals (JCNC) into
   Sonali bags, with the objective of enhancing their physical properties.
   JCNC, obtained through a meticulous 64\% concentrate sulfuric acid
   hydrolysis process, has been reinforced with Sonali Bags at varying
   loadings (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 wt\%). The SEM analysis showed
   spherical cellulose nanocrystals with high crystallinity and distinctive
   tear-like features on the nanoparticle's surface. Furthermore, the SEM
   micrographs depicted that JCNC loading up to 0.2\% helped reduce the
   pore formation of bio-composite. Moreover, the thermal properties
   increased significantly, and tensile strength increased by approximately
   37\% MPa after reinforcing JCNC with Sonali Bag. The water-resistant
   capacity of 0.2\% CNC reinforced film was about 30\% better than other
   compositions. The JCNC-reinforced composite materials were found to
   moderate the degradation rate, contributing to the prolonged
   sustainability of these biodegradable solutions.},

   Behavioral Intentions to Purchase Reduced Plastic Products},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in the use of personal
   protective equipment and single-use plastics, which has exacerbated
   plastic littering on land and in marine environments. Consumer behaviors
   with regards to eco-friendly products, their acceptance, and intentions
   to purchase need to be explored to help businesses achieve their
   sustainability goals. This paper establishes the Sustainability Theory
   of Planned Behavior (STPB), an integration of the TPB and sustainability
   domains, in order to analyze the said objectives. The study employed a
   machine learning ensemble method and used MATLAB to analyze the data.
   The results showed that support and attitude from perceived authorities
   were the main variables influencing customers' intentions for purchasing
   reduced plastic products. Customers with a high level of environmental
   awareness were more likely to embrace reduced plastic items as a way to
   lessen their ecological footprint and support environmental
   conservation, making perceived environmental concern another important
   factor. This shows that authorities play a big role in the community in
   influencing people to choose reduced plastic products, making it the
   duty of governments and companies to promote environmental awareness.
   This study emphasizes the significance of the latent variables
   considered when developing marketing plans and activities meant to
   promote products with less plastic.},

Title = {Technological and Economic Optimization of Wheat Straw Black Liquor
   Decolorization by Activated Carbon},
Journal = {WATER},

Abstract = {Wheat straws are a globally abundant agro-waste that may play a critical
   role in the global transition from single-use plastics to green
   materials as an inexpensive and renewable raw material. Vast amounts of
   wastewater are produced during the technological process of wheat
   straw-cellulose/hemicellulose conversion. In this context, this work
   focuses on wastewater decolorization via activated carbon adsorption. A
   set of carefully planned experiments enabled the identification of a
   model that described the relationship between the system's outputs and
   parameters. While process optimization is frequently connected with
   identifying process parameters that improve efficiency, this work
   employed a multi-objective optimization approach from both a
   technological and economic aspect. Nondominated sorting genetic
   algorithm versions II and III-NSGA-II and NSGA-III algorithms-were
   applied. As objectives, maximum efficiency and minimum cost per
   experiment were followed in different scenarios using pseudoweights and
   trade-off metrics. When optimizing only the efficiency, the results
   indicated a 95.54\% decolorization yield, costing 0.1228
   Euro/experiment, and when considering both the efficiency and cost,
   different solutions were obtained. The lowest cost was 0.0619, with a
   74.42\% decolorization. These findings indicate that incorporating an
   economic perspective into the optimization procedure can improve cost
   estimation and facilitate managerial decision-making.},

Abstract = {Polyethylene-, polyvinylidene chloride-, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl
   substance-coated paper generate microplastics or fluorochemicals in the
   environment. Here, we report an approach for the development of
   oil-resistant papers using an environmentally friendly, fluorine-free,
   water-dispersible poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) coating on kraft paper.
   Carboxylic-functionalized PDMS (PDMS-COOH) was synthesized and
   subsequently neutralized with ammonium bicarbonate to obtain a
   waterborne emulsion, which was then coated onto kraft paper. The water
   resistance of the coated paper was determined via Cobb60 measurements.
   The Cobb60 value was reduced to 2.70 +/- 0.14 g/m2 as compared to 87.6
   +/- 5.1 g/m2 for uncoated paper, suggesting a remarkable improvement in
   water resistance. Similarly, oil resistance was found to be 12/12 on the
   kit test scale versus 0/12 for uncoated paper. In addition, the coated
   paper retained 70-90\% of its inherent mechanical properties, and more
   importantly, the coated paper was recycled via pulp recovery using a
   standard protocol with a 91.1\% yield.},

Abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) have emerged as a global environmental concern due
   to their persistent nature. In South Africa, microplastic research has
   primarily focused on marine systems. However, recent years have seen a
   shift in focus to studying MPs in South African freshwaters. In this
   study, MPs with a minimum size of 0.055 mm in surface water of the Vaal
   River, South Africa, were reported. MPs were 100\% prevalent, with a
   mean numerical abundance of 0.68 +/- 0.64 particles/m(3). Small-sized
   MPs of < 1 mm accounted for the largest proportion. MPs were chemically
   identified as high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, and
   polypropylene according to their Raman spectra. The prevalence of
   fragments (41.6\%) and fibers (38.5\%) over pellets (8.1\%) indicates
   that microplastics are from secondary sources. The prevalence of
   polyethylene and polypropylene is consistent with microplastics being
   from secondary sources. These polymers are commonly used in single-use
   plastics, packing bags, textiles, and containers. These characteristics
   are of great concern due to their implications on the bioavailability
   and toxicological impacts of MPs. Consequently, these properties may
   pose more hazards to aquatic biota inhabiting the Vaal River.},

Journal = {CLEANER WASTE SYSTEMS},

Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In large parts of the global South, conventional methods of treating
   plastic waste including: recycling, banning of single use plastics,
   extended producer responsibility systems, and attempts to reuse plastic
   waste have largely failed to reduce increasing volumes of untreated
   waste in the face of limited policy resources and capacity. This article
   explores the potential for creating plastic upcycling markets that would
   be financially self-sustaining through using plastic waste to develop
   valuable new products. The methodology is to explore a case study, the
   Plastic to Ghar project in Nepal, which seeks to incubate new upcycling
   businesses, with a focus on rural areas that lack proper waste
   management. The project proves the viability of creating customizable
   useful products for secondary markets from plastic waste. The lessons
   center around the need to pay attention to developing sustainable
   business models and more robust policy support to complement
   technological solutions.},

Abstract = {In the discursive battle about the big and important ideas, some topics
   are considered more important than others and more likely to mobilize
   society. More recently, marine plastic pollution has become a key topic
   for environmental movements. In this study, we aimed to contribute to a
   more detailed understanding of how specific issues of sustainability are
   brought forth. Conceptually, we argue that recourse to relational
   theories from science and technology studies might help to strengthen
   the conceptualization of social movement research. By drawing on the
   concept of ``boundary objects{''}, we extend the range of social
   movement approaches in order to better understand how the process of
   framing is put to work materially. The focus on boundary objects can
   therefore explain the selective formation of environmental discourses
   and policies when applied to the field of environmental protection and
   sustainability.},

Title = {Recycling, thermophysical characterisation and assessment of low-density
   polythene waste as feedstock for 3D printing},

Abstract = {Low-density polyethene (LDPE) is extensively used in single-end-use food
   packaging and contributes significantly to global waste plastic. This
   study addresses this challenge by introducing a sustainable approach to
   reclaim and valorise waste LDPE from milk packaging by converting them
   into 3D printing filaments. The process involves extruding shredded LDPE
   pouches into continuous filaments using a modified thermal extruder. The
   research comprehensively investigates the effects of two key extrusion
   parameters, nozzle temperature and screw speed, on the resulting
   filament's physical and mechanical properties. Characterisation efforts
   include dimensional analysis, morphological evaluation, chemical
   integrity assessment, thermal stability analysis, and tensile testing.
   The results show that filaments remain consistently close to 1.75 mm
   diameter, which is required by most commercial FDM 3D printers. The
   filaments are chemically intact, thermally stable, and have high
   toughness across the range of extrusion parameters. The results and a
   preliminary demonstration of 3D printing indicate that the LDPE waste
   can be effectively transformed into consistent filaments that have the
   potential for 3D printing. A carbon footprint assessment underscores the
   environmental benefits of this approach, showing substantial reductions
   in estimated CO2 emissions compared to conventional filament production
   methods. While challenges related to the quality of printed parts
   remain, the research opens avenues for optimizing 3D printing parameters
   and exploring multiple recycling cycles. This work represents a step
   towards sustainable plastic waste management and offers insights into
   transforming single-use plastic items into valuable resources.},

Abstract = {Finding time -efficient and cost-effective data collection methods is a
   challenge when addressing aquatic litter pollution on a global scale. In
   this study, we analysed data on aquatic benthic debris collected
   worldwide by volunteer scuba divers through the Dive Against Debris (R)
   citizen science initiative, examining its relationship with spatial and
   socio-economic factors. Plastic -dominated litter was found in both
   marine (64 \%) and freshwater (48 \%) environments, followed by metal
   and glass. Lower litter abundances have been recorded in high income
   countries such as in Europe, Central Asia and North America. Plastic
   fragments and fishing lines were the most abundant seafloor litter
   items, while takeaway containers (aluminium cans, glass bottles) were
   dominant in freshwater environments. Single -use plastics, including
   objects for food and beverage consumption, accounted for about 1/3 of
   the total benthic aquatic debris. Our findings highlight the need to
   prioritise the fishing industry and change our fast -paced modern
   lifestyle. Citizen science initiatives, once data cleanup is conducted
   to overcome any bias, can provide valuable tools for better
   understanding and quantifying marine litter pollution. The outcomes
   gained can be leveraged to improve consumer awareness and inform
   environmental policies aimed at addressing aquatic litter pollution more
   effectively.},

Abstract = {Promoting the use of reusable takeaway food container (RTFC) in takeaway
   industry is an effective way to reduce the negative environmental
   impacts caused by single-use plastic containers. This study intended to
   figure out the barriers to the new business model deployment through
   evaluating the economic costs and benefits of RTFC from a stakeholder's
   perspective. Taking the pilot RTFC project at a university in Guangdong
   province as a case, we established a holistic cost and benefit analysis
   framework from a stakeholder's perspective. Both the costs and benefits
   with and without a market price of each stakeholder were evaluated using
   market price method and contingent valuation method. The analysis result
   shows that while shifting to reusable takeaway food container, the costs
   and benefits of all the main stakeholders changed. The net benefit of
   consumers is positive about 360 thousand yuan during 2020-2025, while
   the platform company, the university and the restaurants gain negative
   net benefits ranging from - 20 to - 470 thousand yuan under current
   operation situation, which may hinder the sustainable development of
   this new business model. However, the sensitivity analysis shows that
   all the stakeholders could gain a positive net benefit by adjusting the
   rental price, cleaning price and packaging price, as well as optimizing
   the location of recycling cabinets.},

Abstract = {Packaging is one of the major domains in the food processing industry
   that reduces waste and enhances product shelf life. Recently, research
   and development have focused on bioplastics and bioresources to combat
   environmental issues caused by the alarming growth of single-use plastic
   waste food packaging. The demand for natural fibres has recently
   increased because of their low cost, biodegradability and
   eco-friendliness. This article reviewed recent developments in natural
   fibre-based food packaging materials. The first part discusses the
   introduction of natural fibres in food packaging, with a focus on fibre
   source, composition and selection parameters, while the second part
   investigates the physical and chemical ways to modify natural fibres.
   Several plant-derived fibre materials have been utilised in food
   packaging as reinforcements, fillers and packaging matrices. Recent
   investigations developed and modified natural fibre (physical and
   chemical treatments) into packaging using casting, melt mixing, hot
   pressing, compression moulding, injection moulding, etc. These
   techniques majorly improved the strength of bio-based packaging for
   commercialisation. This review also identified the main research
   bottlenecks and future study areas were suggested.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in plastic pollution,
   including improper disposal of personal protective equipment (PPE). This
   study focuses on examining the presence and distribution of discarded
   PPE in three locations in Sonora, Mexico, located within the Gulf of
   California. Transects were conducted in 2021 and 2022, during which PPE
   items were visually identified, photographed, and classified. Face masks
   were found to be the most prevalent PPE type (96\% of the total), with
   polymer-based masks being the most commonly observed (97\% of the
   total). The density of PPE was higher on recreational beaches compared
   to non-recreational ones. Statistical analysis revealed a significant
   difference (W = 217.5, p = 0.014) in the PPE density between the sampled
   recreational beaches in 2021 and 2022, with a higher density recorded in
   the first year. Improper disposal of PPE poses environmental risks and
   potential threats to marine organisms. The documented discarded
   COVID-19-related PPE in this study provides important baseline
   information for future research and monitoring. This information is
   valuable to better understand the ecotoxicological effects of PPE and
   develop effective waste management strategies in the Gulf of California.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Hygiene during slaughtering is paramount for meat processors and plugs
   are often used during slaughtering to reduce contamination from fecal
   matter. These products are rendered along with other waste and are
   considered a serious contaminant to rendering products. A life cycle
   assessment (LCA) was used to determine and compare the environmental
   impacts of plugs made from polypropylene to a protein-based
   thermoplastic (Novatein). For Novatein plugs, resin production dominated
   the non-renewable primary energy (NRPE) use and global warming potential
   (GWP), whereas the impacts from injection molding and packaging
   dominated downstream production. Novatein plugs had a higher GWP than
   the PP plug, but required less NRPE. Two important conclusions were
   drawn: a bio-based material does not necessarily present an overall
   reduced environmental impact in comparison to other products, and
   results can easily be skewed based on allocation methods used for
   impacts from upstream processes, especially considering waste products.
   However, not evident from this LCA is the advantage that Novatein breaks
   down during rendering, safely becoming part of part of the rendering
   products.},

Abstract = {Recently, global awareness of the adverse environmental impacts of
   single-use plastics has risen due to their nonbiodegradability and
   likelihood of ending up in the ocean. Thermoplastic starch (TPS) is an
   alternative material employed for manufacturing single-use products
   because of its high biodegradability, nontoxicity, and low cost.
   However, TPS is moisture sensitive and has poor mechanical properties
   and processability. Blending TPS with biodegradable polyesters,
   including poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), can expand its
   practical applications. This research aims to improve the performance of
   TPS/PBAT blends by adding sodium nitrite, a food additive, and
   considering its effect on the morphological characteristics and
   properties of TPS/ PBAT blends. TPS/PBAT/sodium nitrite (TPS/PBAT/N)
   blends with a TPS:PBAT weight ratio of 40:60 and sodium nitrite
   concentrations of 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 wt\% were prepared by extrusion and
   then blown into films. The acids generated from the sodium nitrite
   during extrusion led to the molecular weight reduction of starch and
   PBAT polymers, causing the increased melt flow ability of the TPS/PBAT/N
   blends. The incorporation of sodium nitrite improved the blends'
   homogeneity and the compatibility between the TPS and PBAT phases,
   resulting in the increased tensile strength, extensibility, impact
   strength, and oxygen barrier properties of the TPS/PBAT blend film.},

Abstract = {Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is a common single-use plastic and a
   major contributor to plastic waste. PET upcycling through enzymatic
   depolymerization has drawn significant interests, but lack of robust
   enzymes in acidic environments remains a challenge. This study
   investigates in-situ product removal (ISPR) of protons and monomers from
   enzymatic PET depolymerization via a membrane reactor, focusing on the
   ICCG variant of leaf branch compost cutinase. More than two-fold
   improvements in overall PET depolymerization and terephthalic acid
   yields were achieved employing ISPR for an initial PET loading of 10
   mgPET mlbuffer-1. The benefit of ISPR was reduced for a lower initial
   loading of 1 mgPET mlbuffer-1 due to decreased need for pH stabilization
   of the enzyme-containing solutions. A back-of-envelop analysis suggests
   that at a modest dilution ratio, ISPR could help achieve savings on
   caustic base solutions used for pH control in a bioreactor. Our study
   provides valuable insights for future ISPR developments for enzymatic
   PET depolymerization, addressing the pressing need for more sustainable
   solutions towards plastic recycling and environmental conservation.},

Abstract = {Plastic waste has become a major contributor to global environmental
   pollution. Some of the environmental impacts of plastic waste include
   littering, the formation of plastic debris in oceans and the
   contamination of freshwater and terrestrial habitats. Policymakers face
   great challenges in mitigating plastic waste. Indonesia is considered
   the second largest contributor of plastic waste in the world. However,
   existing policies have not addressed this issue. Policies, such as bans
   on single-use plastic bags and fees on plastic bags, have recently been
   implemented in some pilot cities, but the results remain unclear. Thus,
   this study proposes feasible policies to mitigate plastic waste in
   Indonesia using system dynamics. Specifically, this study seeks to
   develop a dynamic model of plastic waste mitigation and to propose a
   policy scenario for plastic waste mitigation. The proposed policies
   consist of a plastic bag ban, a plastic bag fee, a recycling centre and
   extended producer responsibility (EPR). The analysis demonstrates that
   an effective mixed policy instrument for reducing plastic waste depends
   on the plastic waste type. Regarding plastic bottles, the effective
   mixed policy is a combination of a recycling centre and EPR. For plastic
   bags, the effective mixed policies include the following combinations: a
   plastic bag fee and plastic bag ban, a plastic bag fee and recycling
   centre and a plastic bag ban and recycling centre.},

   products on human cell-based models},

Abstract = {Originally developed to conserve natural resources, plastic has become a
   global pollution issue due to inadequate waste management. The
   dispersion and weathering of plastic waste in the environment generate
   micro-sized particles. Despite extensive research on the toxicological
   effects of pristine polymers, the impact of microplastics (MPs) from
   consumer plastics is poorly understood. This study investigated the
   cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of cryo-milled single-use plastic
   products (fork and cup) on eight cell lines (Caco-2, HEK001, MRC-5,
   HMEC-1, HepaRG, HMC-3, and T47D) at concentrations from 0.01 to 100 mu
   g/mL. Results showed that 100 mu g/mL of MPs did not significantly
   affect cell viability in Caco-2, HEK001, MRC-5, and T47D. However,
   HMEC-1 and HMC-3 exhibited decreased viability with 10-100 mu g/mL of
   fork particles, while HMC-3 and HepaRG showed reduced viability with 100
   mu g/mL of cup particles. Conversely, cup particles increased HMEC-1
   proliferation at 0.1-100 mu g/mL. Comet assay data indicated that both
   fork and cup exposure led to elevated DNA fragmentation in HMEC-1 and
   HMC-3 cells. These findings indicate that MPs from consumer-grade
   plastics may exhibit cytotoxic and genotoxic effects, with endothelial
   and microglial cells being particularly susceptible.},

Title = {Modified polysaccharides for food packaging applications: A review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES},

Abstract = {Development of new food packaging materials is crucial to reduce the use
   of single-use plastics and to limit their destructive impact on the
   environment. Polysaccharides provide an alternative solution to this
   problem. This paper summarizes and discusses recent research results on
   the potential of modifying polysaccharides as materials for film and
   coating applications. Modifications of polysaccharides significantly
   affect their properties, as well as their application usability.
   Although modifications of biopolymers for packaging applications have
   been widely studied, polysaccharides have attracted little attention
   despite being a prospective, environmentally friendly, and economically
   viable packaging alternative. Therefore, this paper discusses approaches
   to the development of biodegradable, polysaccharide-based food packaging
   materials and focuses on modifications of four polysaccharides, such as
   starch, chitosan, sodium alginate and cellulose. In addition, these
   modifications are presented not only in terms of the selected
   polysaccharide, but also in terms of specific properties, i.e.
   hydrophilic, barrier and mechanical properties, of polysaccharides. Such
   a presentation of results makes it much easier to select the
   modification method to improve the unsatisfactory properties of the
   material. Moreover, very often it happens that the applied modification
   improves one and worsens another property, which is also presented in
   this review.},

Title = {Ecological ramifications of marine debris in mangrove ecosystems:
   Estimation of substrate coverage and physical effects of marine debris
   on mangrove ecosystem in Negombo Lagoon, Sri Lanka},

Abstract = {The adverse environmental impacts on mangrove ecosystems due to
   anthropogenic marine debris contamination have attracted public
   attention not only in Sri Lanka but worldwide. Therefore, quantification
   of marine debris in sensitive ecosystems like mangroves is critical to
   assess the impacts on ecosystem vitality and services. We conducted this
   study to assess the abundance and density of marine debris in Negombo
   lagoon, Western Province, Sri Lanka. We selected two sites (n = 2) using
   the purposive sampling technique. Marine debris cover and concentration
   were calculated to explore the extent of pollution from marine debris.
   The findings revealed that 9.83 +/- 1.05 \% of the substrate of the
   mangrove ecosystem is covered by debris. Nine types of marine debris
   were recorded, and a higher abundance belonged to single-use plastic
   items. A significantly higher debris cover was found in Kadolkele (18.80
   +/- 1.74 \%, n = 120) than in Molekadolwetiya (0.85 +/- 0.03 \%, n =
   120) (One-way ANOVA, p < 0.05). The study indicated that the mangroves
   in lagoon are highly polluted with marine debris and act as ``litter
   catchers.{''} Correlation coefficient analysis was used to find the
   impact of debris cover on physical damage to roots, seedlings, and
   undergrowth vegetation. Correlation analysis revealed that physical
   damage to seedlings and branches/barks have a positive correlation with
   debris cover. To conserve these valuable coastal habitats in Negombo
   lagoon, it is recommended to take remedial measures to reduce arriving
   debris loads and to remove the debris present in mangroves.},

Title = {Eco-Innovative UHPC-Enhancing Sustainability, Workability, and Ductility
   with Recycled Glass Cullet Powder and Plastic Bottle Hybrid Fibers},
Journal = {MATERIALS},

Abstract = {Utilizing waste materials in producing ultra-high-performance concrete
   (UHPC) represents a highly effective approach to creating
   environmentally sustainable concrete using renewable resources. This
   study focused on incorporating ground glass cullet (GP) at various
   replacement levels in UHPC production. Additionally, plastic bottle
   fibers (PBFs) were derived from discarded plastic bottles and employed
   in the mix. The replacement levels for GP spanned from 0\% to 40\%.
   Single-use plastic bottles were transformed into strip fibers, both with
   and without the inclusion of microsteel fibers, at varying contents of
   1.1\% and 2.2\% (volume-based). A single-fiber test was conducted on
   PBFs under different strain rates. The introduction of optimal GP
   content had a profound positive iMPact on compressive strength.
   Incorporating 2.2\% plastic strips induced strain hardening behavior,
   while further inclusion of microsteel fibers resulted in substantial
   enhancements in mechanical properties. Two types of microsteel fibers
   were employed, characterized by different aspect ratios of 65 and 100.
   The optimum GP content was identified as 10\%. Moreover, the UHPC mix
   achieved superior compressive strength, exceeding 140 MPa when composed
   of 1.3\% (volume-based) microsteel fibers with an aspect ratio of 65 and
   2.2\% PBF (volume-based). Notably, mixtures featuring microsteel fibers
   with a higher aspect ratio demonstrated the highest flexural strength,
   exceeding 8000 N in the presence of 2.2\% PBF. Longer microsteel fibers
   exhibited adequate slip properties, facilitating strain transfer and
   achieving a strain-hardening response in conjunction with plastic bottle
   fibers. These findings illuminate the potential for harnessing hazardous
   waste materials to improve the performance and sustainability of UHPC
   formulations.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has gained significant attention to the
   intersection of public health crises and environmental challenges,
   particularly in the context of marine pollution. This paper examines the
   various impacts of the pandemic on marine environments, focusing on the
   pollution attributed to single-use plastics (SUPs) and personal
   protective equipment (PPE). Drawing on a comprehensive analysis of
   literature and case studies, the paper highlights the detrimental
   effects of increased plastic waste on marine ecosystems, biodiversity,
   and human health. Statistical data and graphical representations reveal
   the scale of plastic pollution during the pandemic, emphasizing the
   urgent need for mitigation strategies. The study evaluates innovative
   monitoring techniques and future recommendations, emphasizing
   stakeholder collaboration in sustainable waste management. By broadening
   geographic examples and comparative analyses, it provides a global
   perspective on the pandemic's impact, highlighting the importance of
   international cooperation for safeguarding marine ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has amplified the presence
   of single-use plastic pollutants in the ocean. Africa, for instance,
   used personal protective equipment (PPE) that is disposed of
   indiscriminately into the environment, which is usually washed into the
   ocean. This pollutes the ocean and consequently lowers fishery yields.
   Aside from improper disposal practices, single-use personal protective
   equipment's accumulation in the aquatic environment is caused by the
   absence or inadequate recycling and the lack of alternative uses for
   these wastes. It is estimated that globally, about 129 billion facemasks
   and 65 billion gloves are used each month contributing to widespread
   environmental pollution. This study analyzed and discussed the effects
   of plastic waste on the biodiversity of aquatic environments (ocean) vis
   a vis the management of personal protective equipments across the globe.
   Results from the review conducted showed that single-use personal
   protective equipments have the potential to release harmful chemicals,
   toxic substances, pathogenic microorganisms, and heavy metals into the
   environment and thus can hurt biodiversity and seafood security. To
   limit the identified negative effects, there is a need to regulate the
   use of single-use personal protective equipments and also promote the
   use of reusable masks. Educating and empowering especially coastal
   communities to act collectively to minimize plastic pollution (PPE) is a
   recommended measure for the protection of ocean resources.},

Abstract = {Plastics are in high demand for various uses worldwide because of their
   low cost, versatility, lightweight, low density, flexibility, high
   strength, and durability. An increase in single-use plastics and
   ineffective solid waste disposal and recycling strategies have resulted
   in a global microplastic (MP) pollution epidemic, with negative
   implications for the ecosystem and public health safety. Analytical
   methods, including thermogravimetry and chromatography, have been
   developed to detect MPs. Nevertheless, molecular spectroscopy methods
   such as Near Infrared (NIR), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Raman,
   and fluorescence spectroscopy for MP analysis have gained attention in
   recent years due to their rapidity, low cost, accuracy, and portability
   of spectrometers. This review article provides in-depth coverage of the
   survey of current literature on the challenges, toxicity, sample
   pretreatment, and spectroscopic (Fluorescence, Raman, FTIR) and
   real-time (satellite imagery, unmanned aerial vehicles, and aquatic
   drone technology) microplastic detection methods. Machine learning,
   micro-hyperspectral imaging, and chemometrics approach to microplastic
   detections are discussed. The challenges, future directions, and
   prospects for decreasing global MP pollution and their analysis are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on investigating the effect of hybrid nanofillers on
   the hydration characteristics and soil biodegradability of the
   thermoplastic corn starch (TPCS) hybrid nanofiller biocomposite
   (TPCS-HB) films. The data were benchmarked with that of the pure TPCS
   and TPCS single nanofiller biocomposite (TPCS-SB) as control films. The
   water absorption properties of TPCS, TPCS-SB, and TPCS-HB films were
   analyzed and fitted with the standard Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer
   equation to study the water activity of the films. Besides, the water
   permeability test, water vapor permeability, and soil biodegradability
   of the films were also studied and correlated with the films' surface
   morphology. The results indicated that the TPCS-HB films possess
   excellent hydration resistance and comparable biodegradable rate with
   the TPCS-SB films. The optimal water resistance properties were achieved
   when the optimal ratio of nanobentonite/nanocellulose (4:1) was
   incorporated into the TPCS matrix. The outcomes of this study provide an
   innovative idea and new insights that, by using natural and hybrid
   nanofillers, the hydrophobicity of the TPCS films could be enhanced.
   TPCS-HB films show great potential to be developed into a fully green
   biodegradable TPCS biocomposite film, especially for single-use plastic
   applications.},

Abstract = {This study conducted a choice experiment in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to
   investigate public preferences for plastic waste management strategies.
   The study aimed to identify community favored strategies, uncover
   distinct community segments with varying preferences for effective
   strategies, and develop plausible future scenarios for decision-making.
   Findings revealed that waste segregation is not widely practiced, and
   respondents concerned about plastic waste in the environment. Specific
   favored waste reduction strategies were identified using random
   parameter logit model. Two distinct segments emerged from the latent
   class model, each with unique preferences for plastic waste management
   strategies. Respondents of Chinese ethnicity exhibit greater willingness
   to participate in specific strategies than their non-Chinese
   counterparts. Based on these findings, policy implications include
   targeting Chinese residential associations for pilot projects using
   their favored strategies, implementing single-use plastics bans in
   non-Chinese residential associations, incentivizing gated residential
   associations to promote waste reduction, collaborating with waste
   collection and plastic recycling companies to introduce segregation
   methods and incentives in residential associations, improving recycling
   infrastructure in public places, providing multilingual waste
   segregation guidelines for households, enhancing waste collector
   understanding through capacity building, and developing a comprehensive
   plastic waste management action plan for Kuala Lumpur, potentially
   extendable to other Malaysian cities.},

Abstract = {Packaging is critical for the preservation of merchandise like
   biomedical and food products. However, common packaging materials are
   typically single-use plastics and rarely recycled or repurposed due to
   various challenges. This has created a global plastic pollution disaster
   that affects the health and safety of aquatic and land animals. In this
   study, a novel multilayer packaging assembly consisting of paper,
   thermoplastic starch (TPS), and a thin layer (12 \& mu;m) of PLA, PBAT,
   PHBV (all bio-based polymers), or PVOH (as a common commercial polymer
   for the sake of comparison) were fabricated. The assembly of the
   multilayer samples were studied using a scanning electron microscope
   (SEM), and their characteristics, such as the oxygen and water vapor
   permeation, water and oil Cobb values, seal peel strength (SPS), tear
   strength (TS), and grease barrier properties were evaluated. Results
   indicated that the coatings enhanced the dry and wet strengths of the
   paper. All samples demonstrated considerable grease resistance based on
   Kit test results. Samples coated with TPS followed by PHBV (PTPHBV)
   exhibited the best oxygen (0.024 m3/Bar.m2.s) and water vapor barrier
   (1.79 g/m2.d) properties. Results in this work demonstrated that
   multilayer assemblies based on paper and TPS provide functional
   packaging properties making them promising sustainable material options
   for packaging applications.},

Abstract = {Tourism generates 8\% of all greenhouse gas emissions. One way of
   reducing emissions is to deploy behavioral change interventions that
   entice tourists to behave in more sustainable ways. In search of the
   most effective approaches, we conducted a meta-analysis of 118
   interventions tested in field experiments in the tourism context. Most
   studies targeted beliefs and focused on towel reuse, food waste, or
   resource use. Changing choice architecture (d = 1.40) and increasing
   pleasure (d = 0.66) emerge as the most effective approaches. Imposing
   penalties for unsustainable behavior (d = -0.12) and leveraging social
   norms to trigger sustainable behavior (d = 0.18) have limited
   effectiveness. Future work should re-direct attention from designing
   interventions that modify beliefs toward interventions that change
   choice architecture or increase the pleasure associated with the desired
   behavior, and aim at changing a wider range of behaviors, including
   green transportation and the avoidance of single use plastics.},

Abstract = {The disposal of trash into bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, and
   oceans, is a significant environmental concern with detrimental effects
   on ecosystems and human welfare. Single -use plastics, such as bottles,
   bags, and packaging materials, are among the most common types of trash
   found due to their durability and slow degradation. Therefore, the Water
   Surface Cleaning Robot with Trash Monitoring System is proposed. The
   robot is developed to collect trash on the water's surface and display
   the entire process by using live streaming. The purpose of the project
   is to develop the robot movement and trash collector mechanism and to
   collect data on trash collection using IoT. The proposed robot is
   controlled by RC controller and consists of several parts namely the
   ESP32-WiFi, camera, and Internet of Things (IoT) system.Live streaming
   will allow the robot's operations to be observed and evaluated. The
   result shows the robot is able to detect and collect trash and show live
   streaming during the process. The collected data on trash collection can
   be viewed a laptop and mobile phone.},

Abstract = {The present work compares microplastics (MPs) contamination in two
   charismatic crustaceans: European spiny lobster Palinurus elephas and
   langoustine Nephrops norvegicus. Samples (P. elephas n = 14; N.
   norvegicus n = 15) were collected between 76 and 592 m depth, from four
   sites in west Sardinia, Italy. An extraction protocol was applied on
   stomachs and intestines, separately, and over 500 particles were further
   characterized through mu FT-IR. We document 100 \% occurrence in
   specimens from both species, with P. elephas being significantly more
   contaminated (9.1 +/- 1.75 vs. 3.2 +/- 0.45 MPs individual(-1)),
   ingesting larger MPs with different polymeric composition. The
   scavenging-based feeding strategy of both species could explain such
   exposure to MPs, mostly derived by single-use plastic. The overall
   results highlight that both species are clearly affected by plastic
   pollution, being valuable bioindicators and charismatic species that
   could thus represent excellent flagship species for raising awareness
   toward the global issue of plastic in the marine environment.},

Title = {A Perspective on Plastics and Microplastics Contamination in Garden Soil
   in British Columbia, Canada},

Abstract = {Plastic contamination is commonly reported in urban and rural soils, as
   well as in fresh and ocean waters. Canada's government has attempted to
   limit the contamination of single-use plastic by banning the
   manufacturing and selling of specific types of plastic. In British
   Columbia, current regulations governing commercial composting state that
   when compost has less than 1\% of its dry weight representing foreign
   materials (including plastic), it can be sold and used in soils.
   However, due to the low density of plastic and its potential to break
   down into microparticles, this amount may be enough to become toxic when
   used in agricultural soils. This paper studies contamination of plastic
   in garden soils and summarizes how this can affect the environment with
   a preliminary examination of a garden soil sample. The examination
   showed that the garden soil sample contained mainly low-density
   polyethylene, polyethylene and polypropylene plastics (identified
   through ATR-FTIR) in oxidized and unoxidized forms that can come from
   commercial composting and hypothesizes that this plastic could break
   down into microplastic particles. In order to limit the amount of
   plastic contamination in agricultural soils, it is necessary to modify
   current compost regulations in order to treat plastic differently than
   other foreign materials (glass, metal, wood).},

Title = {Plastic packaging: Are German retailers on the way towards a circular

Abstract = {Environmental pollution caused by single-use plastic packaging waste is
   one of the major problems of our time. As a means of tackling
   environmental damage from plastic, many companies are voluntarily
   committing to promoting a sustainable use of plastic and the idea of a
   circular economy (CE). Among these companies, retailers play an
   interesting role. They are the point of sale of different manufacturers'
   products and, thus, are in direct contact with consumers. This paper
   qualitatively analyzes retailers' plastic strategies as published in
   sustainability reports and press releases. In particular, their
   understanding of the concept of a CE, their perspective on the
   CE-related role of consumers, and the consistency of their objectives
   regarding CE goals are investigated. The results indicate that there is
   a strong focus on recycling, although the retailers also consider means
   of reduction by avoidance and reuse. Consumers are rather seen as a
   barrier to implementing a circular economy at all three levels
   (reduction, reuse, recycling) and are assumed to need waste management
   education.},

Abstract = {In a single serving of boba tea, the non-human actors of the tall
   plastic cups, plastic dome lids, and the giant plastic straws dominate,
   but receive little attention. This article uses recent theories and
   discussions of new materialism to bring together cultural analysis of
   the boba tea consumption phenomenon that could be relevant for
   reflecting on a sustainable future. The article contributes to social
   research of waste by focusing on the mediating functions of plastic
   before it becomes waste. My central argument is that plastic is not
   merely a physical and impartial container in the contemporary food and
   beverage industry. It plays an indispensable role in the visualization,
   mass mediation, and consumption of the boba tea beverage. While current
   waste research often focuses on the ``afterlife{''} of plastic waste as
   it relates to underclass waste workers, recycling economy and global
   waste trade, this article highlights the performative function of
   plastic as it changes the way we imagine time, gender, and waste. I show
   it is the plastic cup that enables boba tea to be so visually and
   gastronomically satisfying in an age when the photogenicity and
   ``Instagrammability{''} of food and beverage have become more relevant
   to taste and distinctions.},

Abstract = {Single use plastic packaging is widely accepted to cause significant
   negative environmental impacts. One option to reduce these impacts is to
   develop commercially viable and socially acceptable reuse systems. Such
   closed loop packaging systems require careful consideration of reverse
   (or circular) logistics, financial modelling, and quality control
   (fulfilling legal requirements and ethical obligations). One of the most
   prominent barriers to the concept of reusable packaging for food is
   safety, dictated by challenges of effective cleaning and pack integrity
   assessment. This research directly addresses cleaning assurance by
   investigating the application of ultraviolet (UV) induced fluorescence
   imaging to optically detect residual food fouling on plastic packaging
   surfaces. This research reports for the first time the evaluation of UV
   fluorescence imaging @370 nm for the detection of food fouling on washed
   PET food pots. The technique is compared against the industry standard,
   adenosine triphosphate swabbing, and is found to provide a comparable
   range of sensitivity, full surface coverage, faster assessment, and is
   suitable for full automation without the use of consumables. The
   technique is evaluated with respect to integration into industrial
   process systems. Plastic packing design implications are discussed in
   this context. (c) 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {The nonchalant nature of plastic cutlery, its long-life period, and its
   durability make it a favourite among users and businesses. However,
   these properties also make it lethal for the environment and are an
   eco-disaster. This case discusses an initiative taken by a social
   enterprise and manufacturing company Ecoware, founded by Rhea Singhal, a
   pharmacologist by profession. Born in Mumbai and bought up in Dubai and
   London, her eco-friendly, biodegradable cutlery is an alternative to
   non-biodegradable single-use plastic cutlery, which, when discarded,
   ends up in sewage, landfills, fields and water bodies posing a threat to
   the environment. Moreover, Ecoware cutlery is also an alternative to
   commercial cutlery, which is made of plastic, has chemical or pesticide
   residue, binder additives, fillers, wax lining, plastic lining or
   coatings, or PFA (per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances), which is
   generally added to tableware and food packing to offer resistance to
   oil, grease and moisture.This Ecoware case examines the correlation
   between sustainability and marketing, with a particular emphasis on
   sustainability marketing. It delves into Ecoware's marketing mix
   strategy and explores the obstacles the company has encountered
   regarding pricing, environmental awareness and the general lack of
   understanding regarding the detrimental effects of plastic cutlery.},

Abstract = {Marine ecosystems are known to be contaminated by microplastics (MPs);
   however, the nature and the accumulation rates of microplastics in
   organisms with different lifestyles and feeding behavior are not well
   known. To contribute to the clarification of the subject, the present
   study was conducted by examining the gastrointestinal tract of 366 fish
   individuals belonging to 13 species, collected by commercial fishermen
   in I(center dot)zmir Bay (Aegean Sea). MPs were detected in all fish
   species and the average number was found to be 2.21 +/- 40.7 items
   ind.-1. Fibers were the most frequently extracted type of MPs. The most
   frequently identified MPs were black and not larger than 3 mm. By using
   the ATR-FTIR spectroscopy on MPs obtained from fish species, it was
   determined that the most frequently consumed plastic polymers were
   polypropylene (PP, 34.5\%) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET, 32.2\%).
   MPs were detected in all fish species examined. In order to reduce MPs
   in the aquatic ecosystem, it is suggested that in the short term,
   single-use plastic products should be banned and the use of
   environmentally friendly products should be promoted, while in the
   medium term, awareness should be raised by emphasizing training in the
   use of these products, and in the long term, all nations should fulfil
   the commitments of the Global Plastic Environment Treaty and ensure
   their follow-up.},

Abstract = {In recent times, the use of discarded single-use plastics in the
   manufacture of value-added products has increased drastically. Their use
   as recycled materials significantly reduce the environmental impact of
   waste plastic pollution, encourage sustainability, and provide an
   alternate solution to their disposal. This research also investigates
   and discusses the use of recycled low-density polyethylene in the form
   of milk pouches, collapsible tubes, and medicinal strips along with coir
   fiber as reinforcement for the fabrication of polymer composites.
   Composites were manufactured by compression molding technique and the
   effect of fiber surface treatment on the mechanical, morphological and
   structural characteristics was studied. Thermal stability was also
   studied by differential scanning calorimetry. It was observed that
   treating cellulosic fibers with 5\% NaOH improved the wettability and
   interfacial adhesion between the fibers and matrix. Thermal stability
   was increased and a better mechanical property was achieved. Based on
   the finding of this research, it was concluded that using recycled
   plastic could produce a notable reduction in waste accumulation and the
   composites made by their incorporation also show better mechanical and
   morphological properties. They proved to be a sustainable and greener
   solution to the problem of waste management.},

Abstract = {The population increases demand for plastic in every sector along with
   single-use plastic rapidly increasing, but it still has a low recycling
   rate. The use of plastic in the form of brick is challenging and overall
   has a better impact on the ecosystem, economy, and industrial
   revolution. In this paper, a study has been done of the available
   research work on plastic bricks from different plastic waste materials.
   It discusses the processes used to make bricks from plastic waste
   materials, the possibility of contamination from the waste materials
   utilized, the lack of pertinent standards, and the public adoption of
   waste materials-based bricks. Furthermore, it focused on research and
   development required for the widespread production and use of bricks
   made from waste materials, not only in terms of technical, economic, and
   environmental considerations but also in terms of standardization,
   governmental policy, and public awareness of waste recycling and
   sustainable development. It has been observed from the study that PET
   has mostly recycled plastic with greater efficiency compared to other
   plastics. However, worldwide global production is followed by PE, PVC,
   and PP. PET has only 5\% contribution to the global recycling of
   plastics.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a generic hybrid methodology for assessing
   economic and environmental impacts along interconnected supply chain
   markets, considering both the material/product level and the market
   mechanisms that govern resource allocation. The methodology is
   illustrated by considering a competitive market and benevolent social
   planner variant of a supply chain equilibrium (SCE) model, applied to
   the specific case of single -use and reusable plastic bottles in
   Belgium. The benevolent social planner optimises a societal welfare
   function that includes all relevant revenues and costs along the plastic
   bottle supply chains - including external environmental damage costs.
   These costs comprise climate damage and are incorporated into the SCE
   model by combining life cycle assessment data with economic data. The
   main advantage of this model setup is that it better represents policy
   reality because it allows to study the effectiveness and efficiency of
   the simultaneous implementation of multiple circular strategies, their
   interactions, and possible rebound effects. The findings indicate that
   when all climate costs are internalised simultaneously, the competitive
   market solution approaches that of the benevolent social planner. Yet,
   when policymakers have fewer instruments at their disposal in relation
   to the number of environmental externalities, the welfare impact of
   competitive market solutions is limited or even negative. Moreover, key
   circular economy practices such as material intensity reduction and
   green design are particularly lagging behind compared to their
   welfare-optimising levels.},

Abstract = {The ideal food packaging materials are recyclable, biodegradable, and
   compostable. Starch from plant sources, such as tubers, legumes,
   cereals, and agro-industrial plant residues, is considered one of the
   most suitable biopolymers for producing biodegradable films due to its
   natural abundance and low cost. The chemical modification of starch
   makes it possible to produce films with better technological properties
   by changing the functional groups into starch. Using biopolymers
   extracted from agro-industrial waste can add value to a raw material
   that would otherwise be discarded. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has
   driven a rise in demand for single-use plastics, intensifying pressure
   on this already out-of-control issue. This review provides an overview
   of biopolymers, with a particular focus on starch, to develop
   sustainable materials for food packaging. This study summarizes the
   methods and provides a potential approach to starch modification for
   improving the mechanical and barrier properties of starch-based films.
   This review also updates some trends pointed out by the food packaging
   sector in the last years, considering the impacts of the COVID-19
   pandemic. Perspectives to achieve more sustainable food packaging toward
   a more circular economy are drawn.},

Abstract = {Plastic waste causes severe environmental impacts worldwide and
   threatens the lives of all creatures. In the medical field, most of the
   equipment, especially personal protective equipment (PPE), is made from
   single-use plastic. During COVID-19, the usage of PPE has increased, and
   is disposed of in landfills after being used once. Worldwide, millions
   of tons of waste syringes are generated from COVID-19 vaccination. A
   practical alternative to utilizing this waste is recycling it to
   reinforce building materials. This research introduces an approach to
   using COVID-19 syringe plastic waste to reinforce building material as
   composite concrete. Reinforced fiber polymer (FRP) concrete materials
   were used to mold cylindrical specimens, which underwent mechanical
   tests for mechanical properties. This study used four compositions with
   0\%, 5\%, 10\%, and 15\% of FRP to create cylindrical samples for
   optimum results. Sequential mechanical tests were carried out on the
   created samples. These specimens were cured for a long period to obtain
   water absorption capability. After several investigations, the highest
   tensile and compressive strengths, approximately 2.0 MPa and 10.5 MPa,
   were found for the 5\% FRP composition samples. From the curing test,
   the lowest water absorbability of around 5\% was found for the 5\% FRP
   composition samples.},

Title = {Transformation of water hyacinth into biodegradable film added with
   carboxymethyl cellulose and chitosan and its characterization},
Journal = {MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS},

Abstract = {The development of biodegradable films using natural materials, such as
   water hyacinth, addresses the environmental impact of plastic waste. The
   production of plastics, especially single-use plastics, has caused
   significant pollution and poses a threat to environmental
   sustainability. Biodegradable films offer a promising solution to
   mitigate this problem, but selecting the right environmentally friendly
   materials remains a challenge. This study investigated the development
   and characterization of biodegradable films derived from water hyacinth.
   Biofilms with the addition of 6 \% CMC and varying chitosan
   concentration significantly affected the films' thickness, moisture
   content, solubility, swelling index, biodegradability, and color. The
   results showed that increasing the chitosan concentration produced
   thicker films and increased the swelling index and biodegradability.
   Films with 5 \% chitosan exhibited better water resistance compared to
   other compositions, while achieving the highest degradation rate of
   21.05 \% within 10 days. Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
   confirmed the presence of hydrophilic groups and indicated potential
   interactions in the film structure. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
   revealed improved cohesiveness and homogeneity of the film surface with
   increasing chitosan concentration, enhancing the film's strength and
   resistance to liquid penetration. Meanwhile, the addition of chitosan
   also improved the lightness and color homogeneity of the film, making it
   more visually appealing. These findings emphasize the potential of water
   hyacinth-derived biodegradable films as an environmentally friendly
   alternative, though further composition optimization is essential to
   achieve the desired properties for sustainable packaging applications.},

   Mechanical and Hygrothermal Study},

Abstract = {In recent decades, plastic waste management has become one of the main
   environmental challenges for today's society. The excessive consumption
   of so-called single-use plastics causes continuous damage to ecosystems,
   and it is necessary to find alternatives to recycle these products. In
   this work, a mechanical and hygrothermal characterisation of novel
   plaster composites incorporating LDPE waste in their interior was
   carried out. Thus, prefabricated plasterboards have been designed with a
   partial replacement of the original raw material with recycled LDPE in
   percentages of 5-10-15\% by volume. The results show how these new
   composites exceeded the 0.18 kN minimum breaking load in panels in all
   cases, while decreases in density and thermal conductivity of up to 15\%
   and 21\%, respectively, were obtained. In addition, an increase of
   3.8\%in thermal resistance was obtained by incorporating these new
   gypsum boards in lightweight fa \& ccedil;ade walls through simulations.
   In this way, a new pathway was explored for the recovery of these wastes
   and their subsequent application in the construction sector.},

Abstract = {Heavy metal concentrations of Pb, Cd, Cr, and Cu leaching from
   single-use plastic cups were identified, and the risks associated with
   them were assessed in real time (up to 10 min). All samples (tea,
   carbonated beverage, and lassi) were placed in disposable plastic cups
   and held for less than 1 min, 5 min, and 10 min, respectively. Prior to
   digestion, the solids were ashed in a muffle furnace at 550 degrees C
   for 30 min. The filtrates were then tested for heavy metals. The samples
   were all confirmed to be contaminated with heavy metals. Heavy metals
   leached from the plastic cups in the following order: Cu > Pb > Cr > Cd.
   The samples' HI values were less than one, hence there was no evidence
   of a non-carcinogenic risk. The ILCR values for this heavy metal
   contamination in samples exceed 10(-3), indicating a high carcinogenic
   risk. Lassi poses the highest possible carcinogenic risk. A rise in
   temperature and a drop in pH also resulted in heavy metal migration.
   Heavy metal leaching from plastic cups poses a serious health risk due
   to its toxicity. The proposed legislation should prohibit or restrict
   the serving of warm and hot beverages in plastic cups.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe provision of healthcare itself contributes to the global
   health crisis of the climate emergency. As critical care is a carbon
   hotspot within hospital medicine, healthcare professionals must take
   collaborative action to mitigate the environmental impact of the
   sector.AimsThe purpose of the project was to engage the critical care
   multidisciplinary team with sustainability efforts, through involvement
   in a recycling Quality Improvement Project (QIP). The central QIP aimed
   to increase the recycling rates of single-use plastic enteral feed
   bottles in the intensive care unit (ICU) over a 31-day period.Study
   DesignA recycling `challenge month' was launched, and staff opinion was
   surveyed before and after this intervention.ResultsThe QIP demonstrated
   an increase in feed bottle recycling by 53.2\%, representing a
   carbon-saving effect of up to 6.02 kg CO2e for the intervention month.
   Following the central QIP, all survey respondents felt encouraged to
   consider their ICU's environmental impact.ConclusionsSimple successful
   QIPs can act as a springboard to engage the staff body with
   sustainability initiatives and ignite wider conversation and
   consideration of the climate emergency in daily practice.Relevance for
   Clinical PracticeEffective recycling constitutes only one element of
   responsible environmental stewardship, but authors discuss that it is an
   effective focus for QIPs. To maximize impact and success within critical
   care, nursing involvement in leading and participation is essential.},

Journal = {THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {To response the calls of reducing single-use plastic consumption,
   scientists are increasingly interested in exploring alternatives to
   plastic for making drinking straws. Many commercial ecofriendly drinking
   straws are made using several raw materials namely paper, wheat, or
   rice. These involve complex machinery process and advanced technology
   that are too complicate for students to learn applying skills and
   knowledge in implementation. One of alternatives is the straw from
   nature innovation of Sakon Nakhon Rajabhat University (SNRU). It uses
   flours as raw materials and relies on basic science knowledge of
   polymer. The innovation has been simplified as an affordable science
   learning kit for students learning science through making edible
   drinking straws without using machine and chemical contained. This study
   developed a STEAM activity ``Eco-Friendly Straw{''} based the science
   learning kit to examine students' basic science process skills (BSPS).
   The STEAM activity consisted of four sections corresponding to
   six-procedure engineering design process (EDP). The samples were 120
   students from secondary school and high school levels with 60 people per
   level. The students' group worksheets and produced drinking straws were
   analyzed and revealed that BSPS performance of the high school students
   was higher. The art discipline of the STEAM activity was found fostering
   learning engagement of the students whose BSPS scores were low. The
   change of pre-test to post-test on polymer of both student levels was
   found a significant difference. The satisfaction of the secondary school
   students was higher. Guidance for teachers interested applying this
   STEAM activity to their classrooms is provided.},

Abstract = {The article presents the implemented solution for the organization of a
   pioneer scouting camp located in Poland on Babinka Lake following the
   principles of sustainable development. The camp was not located on a
   camping site or in a scout cabin, but in a place that had to be
   adequately prepared for the 2-week stay of 50 participants. It was
   necessary to provide water for drinking and preparing meals, water for
   washing, sanitary facilities, and waste segregation. Scouts who wanted
   to act according to sustainable development goals decided to eliminate
   the use of water in plastic containers. Before the camp, a local
   inspection of the area was carried out, the possibility of drawing water
   from a nearby deep well was checked, pilot holes were made in other
   locations, and water samples were collected and tested for
   physicochemical and bacteriological parameters. A solution consisting of
   bringing safe drinking water and using lake water for washing was
   proposed, and a safe location of latrines and places to store segregated
   waste was also indicated. Our study proved that it is possible to
   abandon the use of single-use plastic water containers and other
   non-eco-friendly solutions during the scout camps and provide a water
   supply more sustainably. Following this study, organizers can reduce the
   negative impact on the environment on the campsite.},

Title = {Deterioration of single-use biodegradable plastics in high-humidity air
   and freshwaters over one year: Significant disparities in surface
   physicochemical characteristics and degradation rates},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {465},

Abstract = {More single-use plastics are accumulating in the environment, and
   likewise biodegradable plastics (BPs), which are being vigorously
   promoted, cannot escape the fate. Currently, studies on the actual
   degradation of BPs in open-air and freshwaters are underrepresented
   despite they are potentially headmost leakage and contamination sites
   for disposable BPs. Herein, we compared the degradation behavior of six
   BP materials and non-degradable polypropylene (PP) plastics over a
   1-year in situ suspension in the high-humidity air, a eutrophic river,
   and an oligotrophic lake. Moreover, a 3-months laboratory incubation was
   performed to detect the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from
   BPs. In both air and freshwaters, poly(p-dioxanone) (PPDO) degraded
   significantly while PP and polylactic acid (PLA) showed no signs of
   degradation. The average degradation rates of three poly (butylene
   adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT)-based films varied: 100\% in river,
   55\% in lake, and 10\% in air. In addition to PLA, surface chemical
   groups, hydrophilicity, and thermal stability of BPs changed, and
   microplastics were found on their surfaces. Correspondingly, BPs with
   faster degradation rates released relatively higher amounts of DOC.
   Environmental microbial and chemical characteristics may contribute to
   differences in BP degradation besides polymer specificity. Altogether,
   our results indicate the need for appropriate monitoring of BPs.},

Title = {Disposable e-cigarettes and cigarette butts alter the physiology of an
   aquatic plant Lemna minor (Lemnaceae)},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Cigarette butts are one of the most littered single-use plastic items
   worldwide and can have ecotoxicological effects. e-Cigarettes (or
   `vapes') have gained popularity globally as an alternative to
   tobacco-based cigarettes in recent years. The increased availability of
   disposable e-cigarettes has resulted in a rise in their littering,
   presenting a complex form of e-waste in the environment, yet the
   environmental impacts of littered e-cigarettes are largely unknown. Here
   Lemna minor (common duckweed) was used as a model organism to understand
   the effects of smoked cigarettes, vaped e-cigarettes or e-liquid.
   Growth-related physiological responses were measured (biomass, root
   development and frond chlorophyll content). After 14 days of exposure to
   cigarette butts there was an increase of all measured growth variables.
   On the contrary, exposure to e-cigarettes or e-liquid caused a decrease
   in root length, biomass and frond number relative to controls. The
   significant deviations from control conditions suggest that the presence
   of either cigarette butts, e-cigarettes or e-liquid caused stress to the
   model plant which could indicate disruption of aquatic ecosystems at the
   primary producer level. Disposable vapes pose a novel threat to aquatic
   ecosystems and it would be prudent to prevent them from becoming the
   next top litter item.},

Abstract = {The short lifespan and lack of sufficient recycling systems for plastic
   packaging like PET water bottles leds to higher fossil hydrocarbon
   extraction, carbon emissions, and environmental pollution. Manufacturing
   bioplastics like polylactic acid (PLA) and bio-poly-ethylene (bio-PE)
   are 2 strategies being promoted in the European bioeconomy along with
   recycling. However, research is lacking on the carbon neutrality of
   producing microalgae bioplastic packaging and its recycling. This study
   aims to determine the techno-economic feasibility and carbon footprint
   of scaled microalgae bioplastic bottle production through a
   joint-venture project with a bioenergy plant. 3 scenarios were evaluated
   for their financial viability and carbon neutrality. In scenario 1,
   algae sugars are converted into biogas for bioenergy. In scenarios 2 and
   3, the microalgae sugars are transformed into PLA plastic pellets and
   bio-PE plastic pellets, respectively. The life cycle analysis of
   scenarios 2 and 3 was also extended for plastic bottle manufacturing and
   recycling. The results show that the algae plastic biorefinery is highly
   reliant on the bioenergy producer's electricity and steam heat sales to
   cover its capital and operational costs. While scenario 1 was
   financially viable, scenarios 2 and 3 were limited at larger scales.
   Recycling the PLA and bio-PE resulted in higher CO2 savings than other
   end-of-life options like disposal and other biomass feedstocks. This
   study seeks to provide resources and insights about the strengths and
   weaknesses of algae bioplastic production for single-use plastic
   bottles.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},

Abstract = {Body coveralls, often made of single-use plastics, are essential
   Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and, along with masks, are widely
   used in healthcare facilities and public spaces in the wake of the
   recent COVID-19 pandemic. The widespread use of these body coveralls
   poses a significant threat to terrestrial and aquatic eco-systems, given
   their polluting nature and disposal frequency. Therefore, it is
   necessary to promote the adoption of alternatives that increase the safe
   reusability of PPE clothing and reduce environmental and health hazards.
   This study presents a comparative Cradle-to-Grave Life Cycle Assessment
   (LCA) of disposable and reusable PPE body coveralls from a product life
   cycle perspective. A comprehensive life cycle inventory and LCA
   framework specific to Indian conditions have been developed through this
   study. The LCA is performed as per standard protocols using SimaPro
   software under recipe 2016 (H) impact assessment method. Six midpoint
   impact cat-egories viz. Global Warming Potential, Terrestrial
   Acidification, Freshwater Eutrophication, Terrestrial Ecotox-icity,
   Human Carcinogenic Toxicity, and Water Consumption are assessed, along
   with Cumulative Energy Demand. Results suggest that reusable PPE
   improves environmental and human health performance in all the impact
   categories except water consumption. Sensitivity analysis reveals that
   replacing conventional electricity with solar energy for PPE
   manufacturing and disposal will provide additional environmental
   benefits. The findings can help the medical textile industries,
   healthcare workers, and policymakers to make environmentally informed
   choices.},

Abstract = {The Association of Southeast Asian Nations is blessed with agricultural
   resources, and with the growing population, it will continue to prosper,
   which follows the abundance of agricultural biomass. Lignocellulosic
   biomass attracted researchers' interest in extracting bio-oil from these
   wastes. However, the resulting bio-oil has low heating values and
   undesirable physical properties. Hence, co-pyrolysis with plastic or
   polymer wastes is adopted to improve the yield and quality of the
   bio-oil. Furthermore, with the spread of the novel coronavirus, the
   surge of single-use plastic waste such as disposable medical face mask,
   can potentially set back the previous plastic waste reduction measures.
   Therefore, studies of existing technologies and techniques are referred
   in exploring the potential of disposable medical face mask waste as a
   candidate for co-pyrolysis with biomass. Process parameters, utilisation
   of catalysts and technologies are key factors in improving and
   optimising the process to achieve commercial standard of liquid fuel.
   Catalytic co-pyrolysis involves a series of complex mechanisms, which
   cannot be explained using simple iso-conversional models. Hence,
   advanced conversional models are introduced, followed by the
   evolutionary models and predictive models, which can solve the
   non-linear catalytic co-pyrolysis reaction kinetics. The outlook and
   challenges for the topic are discussed in detail.},

Abstract = {There is a strong reliance on fossil fuel-based plastics in the life
   sciences sector and it has been estimated that global life-sciences
   (biology, medicine, etc.) alone create plastic waste of approximately
   5.5 million tonnes/year with 99\% of single-use laboratory plastics made
   from fossil-fuel sources There is growing interest in the viability of
   bioplastics as an alternative to fossil fuel-based single-use plastics
   in laboratory settings. Here, we report the use of polylactic acid (PLA)
   in the production of a single-use Petri dish. The properties of the PLA
   Petri dish are tested and compared to the standards for assessing
   plastics for use in labware, as per the International Organization for
   Standardization (ISO). We demonstrate, for the first time, that a
   compostable PLA Petri dish meets all the necessary standards for use in
   laboratories, thereby taking the first steps towards reducing the
   negative impacts of plastic waste in laboratories.},

Abstract = {Increasing concern about environmental pollution has led researchers to
   find sustainable alternatives to synthetic counterparts. With the
   packaging industry accounting for 42 percent of plastics entering our
   marine systems, governments have also passed legislation banning
   single-use plastics. This paper essays the fabrication and experimental
   validation of hybrid bio composite with coir and cotton fiber
   reinforcement dispersed in paper matrix. Specimen with varying
   concentration of coir and different fiber length was validated against
   150 GSM standard packaging paper material. The specimen constituted by
   20 wt\% coir was observed to have better tensile strength of 2.678
   N/mm2, Izod higher impact value of 0.15 J compared to the standard
   sample which had tensile strength of 1.875 N/mm2 and lower Izod impact
   value of 0.10 J. Increasing coir content led to 142.4\% higher water
   absorption and was not appreciable for making carry bags. The thermal
   stability characteristics of composite specimens were comparable to
   conventional packaging materials.},

Abstract = {Green school is a school that encourages students and the school
   community to have environmentally caring attitudes and behaviors in
   daily activities both at school and where they live. At a further stage,
   the green school program also seeks to integrate environmental aspects
   into learning according to the learning topic or in what is termed a
   green curriculum. In Indonesia, a green school program was known as the
   adiwiyata program. The purpose of this study was to analyze how students
   perceive green schools. The research was conducted at SMA N 3 Surakarta,
   one of the national green schools in Surakarta. The research method was
   carried out with a quantitative approach with a questionnaire-based
   survey of 171 students. The results showed that most green school
   students state that their school has implemented four criteria of the
   green school program, namely the existence of environmentally friendly
   policies, implementation of an environmentally-based curriculum,
   participatory-based environmental activities, and management of
   ecologically friendly supporting facilities. The school management has
   been carried out by the principles of sustainable environmental
   management, such as providing green open spaces, waste management,
   reducing the use of single-use plastics, making biopore infiltration
   holes, and others.},

Abstract = {The Remembrance Poppy is an iconic artificial flower that is prevalently
   worn in Commonwealth countries in the period preceding the Remembrance
   Day to commemorate their military personnel. The current version of the
   Remembrance Poppy is a multi-material design made of fossil plastic
   (i.e., light-density polyethylene, LDPE) and paper; this prevents its
   widespread recycling and ascribes the Poppy to the realm of single-use
   plastics. In this study, we quantify the environmental performance of
   the current and alternative designs of the Remembrance Poppy via a
   detailed Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), with the objective of supporting
   decision-making by the Royal British Legion Group, whose group charities
   provide the Remembrance Poppy across the UK. We consider two alternative
   designs: (i) one envisaging an increased recycled content (30\% for LDPE
   and 50\% for paper) compared to the current design and (ii) a novel,
   mono-material design fully made of paper. For the latter we consider
   three sub-scenarios with increasing recycled content from 50\% to 100\%,
   as well as two options considering or not recycling of the Poppy at the
   end of its life. The system boundaries are cradle-to-grave. The
   inventory data combines primary data collected from RBL group and a
   paper supplier, and secondary data from LCA databases. The environmental
   impacts are quantified via the Environmental Footprint 2.0 method. The
   LCA study indicates that the paper-based design is overall the
   environmentally preferable option, yielding environmental benefits
   (after normalization and weighting) ranging from 39\% to 59\% compared
   to the current design, according to the specific scenario. The
   recycled-content plastic-based design is also preferable but by a
   smaller amount (11\%). The study highlights the importance of using
   increasing percentages of recycled content, as well as that of designing
   product that are recyclable at the end of their life, which are tenets
   of the Circular Economy paradigm.
   Shifting from plastic to a paper-based design significantly reduces the
   environmental impacts of the UK Remembrance Poppy.},

Abstract = {Scientific research pushes forward the boundaries of human knowledge,
   but often at a sizable environmental cost. The reliance of researchers
   on single-use plastics and disposable consumables has come under
   increased scrutiny as decarbonisation and environmental sustainability
   have become a growing priority. However, there has been very little
   exploration of the contribution of laboratory consumables to `greenhouse
   gas' (GHG) carbon emissions. Carbon footprint exercises, if capturing
   consumables at all, typically rely on analyses of inventory spend which
   broadly aggregate plastic and chemical products, providing inaccurate
   data and thus limited insight as to how changes to procurement can
   reduce emissions. This paper documents the first effort to quantify the
   carbon footprint of common, single- use lab consumables through emission
   factors derived from life cycle assessments (LCAs). A literature review
   of LCAs was conducted to develop emission factors for lab consumables,
   considering the emission hotspots along each product's life cycle to
   identify where emission reduction policies can be most effective.
   Results can be used as inputs for lab practitioners seeking to
   understand and mitigate their carbon footprint.},

Abstract = {With increasing strict regulation on single-use plastics, lactic acid
   (LA) and alkyl lactates, as essential monomers for bio-degradable
   polylactic acid (PLA) plastic products, have gained worldwide attention
   in both academia and industry. While LA is still dominantly produced
   through fermentation processes from start, chemical synthesis from
   cellulosic biomass remains a grand challenge, owing to poor selectiv-ity
   in activating C-H and C-C bonds in sugar molecules. To our best
   knowledge, recent publications have been focused on hydrothermal
   conversion of glucose to LA, while this review summarizes the highlights
   on direct thermal conversion of fructose as starting material to LA and
   derivatives. In particular, the syn-ergies of metal/metal cations and
   acid/base catalysts will be critically revised on retro-aldol and
   dehydra-tion reactions. This work will provide insights into rational
   design of active and selective catalysts for the production of
   carboxylic acids from biomass feedstocks.(c) 2022 The Chemical Industry

Title = {Sustainable management of drinking plastic straws is required to reduce
   plastic pollution: Are we using them more during COVID-19?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ADVANCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Nowadays, single-use plastic pollution attracts the attention of
   scholars, policymakers, and practitioners. In addition to personal
   protective equipment (PPEs) waste during the COVID-19 pandemic, other
   unpreceded plastic wastes such as packaging from online shopping and
   food delivery, viruses confirmatory testing, and drinking straws also
   contributed to pollution and worsened around the globe. This perspective
   aimed to provide insights into drinking plastic straws as an important
   source of plastic pollution. Literature searches confirmed that drinking
   plastic straws, unlike PPEs, have not been researched whether it is an
   important contributor to pollution or not during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Thus, research on the pollution level of this plastic waste and its
   association with COVID-19 is required. Drinking straw producers and
   users require adequate strategies and management of this plastic
   pollution and more widespread rules and regulations to prevent
   environmental implications and health risks. This study can usefully
   give highlights for environmentalists, solid waste management experts,
   policymakers, and governments by describing the environmental impact and
   raising health risks of drinking plastic straw pollution.},

Abstract = {Replacing single-use plastic delivery bags (SPDBs) with cellulose-based
   materials is an effective strategy to reduce environmental pollution.
   However, the inherent hydrophilicity and ultralow mechanical strength of
   cellulose materials limit its development. In this study, zinc oxide
   (ZnO)-cellulose composite films were successfully prepared through
   ``two-step strategy{''} of lotus leaves structure simulation, including
   deposition of micro-nano ZnO particles and stearic acid (STA)
   modification. Well-dispersed micro-nano ZnO particles with stick-like
   structure were anchored in the ZnO-cellulose composite film prepared at
   90 degrees C (CF-90). Due to the special structural design and strong
   interaction between the cellulose and micro-nano ZnO particles, the
   CF-90 showed higher mechanical property (a 47.8 \% improvement in the
   tensile strength). Impressively, CF-90 also exhibited great UV shielding
   properties with larger UPF value of 1603.98 and superhigh heat-barrier
   performance. Moreover, CF-90 obtained excellent superhydrophobicity with
   a water contact angle of 163.6 degrees by further modification.
   Consequently, the versatile cellulose-based material bringing a dawn on
   application of sustainable packaging materials for express delivery

Title = {Corporate engagement in mitigating plastic pollution: examining
   voluntary initiatives and EU regulations},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 11},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution has emerged as a critical global environmental
   challenge, with far-reaching ecological, economic, and social
   implications. This article addresses the fragmented nature of the
   current literature on plastic pollution regulations and their impact on
   the corporate sector and aims to bridge this gap by providing a
   comprehensive analysis of the current EU regulatory framework and
   corporate voluntary self-regulatory initiatives relevant to plastic
   pollution. Examining voluntary initiatives - including corporate social
   responsibility (CSR) programs and the emerging concept of plastic
   credits - in terms of their potential to tackle plastic pollution and
   promote environmental sustainability, the article presents novel
   insights on how different regulatory mechanisms and voluntary
   self-regulatory initiatives engage the corporate sector in mitigating
   plastic pollution. While highlighting the importance of collaborative
   efforts between regulatory bodies and businesses, the study critically
   evaluates the challenges and limitations of current approaches. It
   addresses concerns about the efficacy and transparency of CSR
   initiatives, with particular attention to the issue of greenwashing and
   its potential legal implications. By synthesizing diverse sources, this
   article emphasizes the need to combine stringent regulatory frameworks
   with responsible business practices to engage the corporate sector in
   preventing and mitigating plastic pollution, specifically within the
   context of the European Union's pioneering environmental policy.
   Ultimately, the study suggests that the most effective long-term
   solution lies in reducing plastic production altogether while
   acknowledging the role of transitional measures in the interim.},

   packaging materials: A review},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN MATERIALS SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The current packaging materials market is dominated by
   petrochemical-derived, single-use, and inexpensive plastics that are
   incredibly stable in the environment. After their sole use, only a small
   fraction is recycled, with the remaining ending up in landfills,
   incineration facilities, or littered in the environment threatening the
   health of our environment. Nature-derived, com-postable, and
   biodegradable polymers are appealing alternatives to replace single-use
   plastics in packaging and coating applications. However, most
   sustainable polymer alternatives cannot compete with traditional
   plastics in key packaging property attributes, such as gas and moisture
   barrier properties. Thus, there is a dire need to design chemistries and
   processing technology to enhance the barrier properties of sustainable
   polymer systems. In this review, we conducted a critical and
   comprehensive summary of the important and impactful contributions on
   improving the gas and moisture barrier properties of sustainable polymer
   systems for packaging applica-tions. The work highlights signature
   accomplishments on the effect of tuning the microstructure, surface
   energy, morphology, and self-assembly of polymers on the gas and
   moisture barrier properties of the resulting films and coatings. The
   recent developments in designing multiphase and multicomponent systems
   and the impact of nanotechnology on barrier properties of sus-tainable
   packaging plastics are emphasized.},

Abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) is amongst the most frequently used
   methodologies to identify and evaluate the environmental impacts of the
   circular supply chain configurations. This article aims to showcase how
   a socio-material perspective can increase the embeddedness of such an
   assessment within inter-firm networks. A comparative LCA of two circular
   product systems is conducted, namely single-use and reusable tableware
   within a canteen located in northern Italy. To contextualise the LCA,
   the Actor Network Theory (ANT) is used as an epistemological lens to
   identify the framing and problematisation of bioplastics in Italy, as
   well as the power constellation of actors affecting the bioplastics life
   cycle. The ANT complements the LCA in three ways: firstly, it informs
   the end-of-life modelling of the product systems away from public
   narratives to the actual waste management practices and secondly, it
   contextualises the interpretation of the LCA results-in favour of the
   reuse system-with the socio-technical factors in Italy. Finally, the
   socio-material perspective allows for a discussion on the performative
   role of LCA in the light of its increasing popularity in the public and
   private sectors and on its potential to guide more sustainable
   production and consumption patterns.},

Abstract = {Non-sustainable single-use plastics used for food packaging needs to be
   phased out. Films made from cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are suitable
   candidates for biodegradable and recyclable packaging materials as they
   exhibit good mechanical properties, excellent oxygen barrier properties
   and high transparency. Yet, their poor water vapour barrier properties
   have been a major hindrance in their commercialisation. Here, we
   describe the preparation of 25 mu m thick CNF films with significantly
   improved water vapour barrier properties after deposition of ultrathin
   polymeric and metallic coatings, parylene C and aluminium, respectively.
   When first adding a 40 nm aluminium layer followed by an 80 nm parylene
   layer, i.e. with a combined thickness of less than one percent of the
   CNF film, a water vapour transmission rate of 2.8 g m(- 2) d(-1) was
   achieved at 38 C and 90 \% RH, surpassing a 25 mu m polypropylene film
   (4-12 g m(- 2) d(-1)). This is an improvement of more than 700 times
   compared to uncoated CNF films, under some of the harshest possible
   conditions a packaging material will need to endure in commercial use.
   The layers showed a good and even coverage, as assessed by atomic force
   microscopy, and the parylene-coated surfaces were hydrophobic with a
   contact angle of 110, providing good water repellency.},

Title = {Producing Blends of Polybutylene Adipate Terephthalate and Blood Meal
   That Are Safe to Render},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Single-use plastic hygiene control products used during red meat
   processing can have severe negative impacts on the environment and
   cannot be processed with offal during rendering into meat and bone meal.
   However, plastics made from protein could potentially solve this problem
   as the material would be safe to render. The objective of this work was
   to prepare blends of blood meal and polybutylene adipate terephthalate
   (PBAT) in the absence of water using the interaction between PBAT and
   protein as the plasticisation mechanism. The ratio of protein to PBAT
   (1:1.3), as well as the choice of compatibiliser (PBAT-g-IA), was
   critical to form a homogenous, compatibilised blend with mechanical
   properties suitable for injection-moulded hygeine control products. This
   blend had a tensile strenght of 11.2 MPa, a chord modulus of 492 MPa,
   and 10\% elongation at break. Using less PBAT in the blend, or using
   Surlyn (TM) as a compatibiliser, resulted in blends that were either too
   difficult to process or with inferior mechancial properies. Using
   simulated rendering, the new material was indistinguishable from tallow
   or meat and bone meal, suggesting that hygeine control products made
   from this new material will degrade sufficiently to be safe to render
   with offal after red meat processing.},

Title = {Environmentally Benign Partially Delignified and Microwave Processed
   Bamboo-Based Drinking Straws},
Journal = {ADVANCED SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Single-use plastic straws are a significant environmental concern as
   they pollute the ecosystem and drastically harm humans and aquatic
   organisms. Paper straws, as an alternative have limitations such as weak
   mechanical properties, poor water stability, and the use of coatings or
   adhesives that hinder their biodegradability. The present study reports
   a facile approach for preparing mechanically robust, water-stable, and
   biodegradable straws using partially delignified and microwave (MW)
   treated bamboo. The MW-processed bamboo-based straws present water
   stability for up to 16 h and a contact angle of 87.8 degrees, suggesting
   low wettability and water stability for long periods. The processed
   straws show improved tensile strength of 59.3 MPa, Young's modulus of
   988 MPa, and a flexural strength of 13.9 MPa, along with >97\%
   biodegradation (98 days). MW treatment is a rapid and low-cost strategy
   for physiochemical modification that can be used for the large-scale
   production of drinking straws from biomass. The life cycle analysis
   (LCA) shows that MW-irradiated bamboo straws generate 86.53\% less
   global warming potential (GWP) impact during production and 91.8\% less
   human health damage impact during end-of-life (EOL), compared to plastic
   straws. MW-treated drinking straws from bamboo can thus become a
   low-cost, eco-friendly, biodegradable, and sustainable alternative to

Abstract = {The world's population is growing steadily, and this trend is mirrored
   by a sharp rise in the number of people who smoke cigarettes. Instead of
   properly disposing of their cigarette waste, most people simply toss
   them aside, leading to serious environmental consequences. According to
   previous statistics, in 2012 alone, 6.25 trillion cigarettes were
   consumed by 967 million chain smokers. Past studies have shown that up
   to 30\% of global litter is made up of cigarette waste. These discarded
   cigarette butts are non-biodegradable and contain over 7000 toxicants
   such as benzene, 1,3-butadiene, nitrosamine ketone,
   N-Nitrosonornicotine, nicotine, formaldehyde, acrolein, ammonia,
   aniline, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and various heavy metals.
   These toxicants have a negative impact on the habitats of wildlife and
   can cause serious health problems such as cancer, respiratory disorders,
   cardiac issues, and sexual dysfunction. Although it is still unclear how
   littered cigarettes affect plant growth, germination, and development,
   it is clear that they have the potential to harm plant health. Just like
   single-use plastic, trashed cigarette butts are a critical new rising
   form of pollution that requires scientific attention for effective
   recycling and disposal management. It is important to properly dispose
   of cigarette waste to protect the environment and wildlife, as well as
   to prevent harm to human health.},

Abstract = {In the 1960s, the Swedish company Celloplast patented the first
   one-piece plastic bag for packaging, and such plastic bags are heavily
   used all around the world until they are banned by some countries for
   environmental and sustainability reasons. Similarly, the EU banned
   certain single-use plastic items in 2021-but food packaging is not part
   of this new regulation. And indeed, the majority of food packaging
   encountered today in the supermarket is still made from traditional,
   petrol-based plastics. This review summarizes recent efforts in
   developing more sustainable alternatives to such petrol-based food
   packaging. Different natural sources and production processes used to
   develop biodegradable, biopolymer-based materials (bbMs) are discussed,
   which are categorized into natural bbMs, modified/plasticized bbMs, and
   plastic bbMs. An overview of the material properties of commercially
   available bbMs and bbMs developed in academic research projects is
   provided, and are compared with the properties of conventional,
   petrol-based materials used for packaging. Furthermore, the role of
   academic and industrial contributors along the value chain of bbMs is
   highlighted and challenges that are responsible for the still limited
   occurrence of bbMs in daily lives are discussed.},

Abstract = {Thin plastic films used for packing food materials are unsafe for
   consumers and are not readily degradable. Single-use plastic films
   accumulate in the environment and cause adverse effects in the food
   chain. In this study, Kappaphycus alvarezii, which has the value-added
   polymer carrageenan, was used for developing a bioplastic film along
   with the plasticizer polyethylene glycol (PEG 3000). Different
   concentrations of seaweed were used (3\%, 4\% and 5\% dry weight), of
   which 4\% had a higher tensile strength than the other concentrations.
   The physical and mechanical properties of the developed plastic films,
   such as thickness, tensile strength (TS), water vapor transmission rate
   (WVTR), oxygen transmission rate (OTR) and color, were tested for
   packaging applications in the food industry. A higher concentration of
   seaweed increased the WVTR, and a lower concentration increased the OTR.
   In addition, the biodegradation of the developed bioplastic was tested
   using isolated deep-sea microbial consortia to meet environmental
   standards. A deep-sea marine microbial consortium (Bacillus
   paralicheniformis G1, Bacillus subtilis G2, Bacillus subtilis Z1, and
   Enterobacter cloacae subsp. dissolvens Z2) degrades seaweed (Kappaphycus
   alvarezii)-derived bioplastic under buried soil conditions. The maximum
   degradation (88\%) in the 5\% (w/v) bioplastic film was observed within
   10 days of incubation.},

Title = {The environmental consequences of oral healthcare provision by the
   dental team},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {142},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objectives: To undertake a comparative ecological impact (Total lifetime
   carbon footprint and single use plastics (SUP) waste generation) derived
   from the provision of professional oral healthcare (Dentists and
   hygienist) to five different patient categories up to the age of 50
   years, representative of different levels of progressive dental disease
   and treatment experience. Method: CO2e and SUP waste generated was
   calculated for five patient categories with common preventable diseases;
   that are representative of different levels of progressive dental
   disease and treatment experience. The assessment is based on the average
   restorative care levels for 50-year-olds in the UK. The number of
   appointments for each procedure was calculated using current
   evidence-based guidelines. The total lifetime carbon and the SUP waste
   analysis was calculated using published peer-reviewed data. Results: The
   total carbon footprint follows a progression with low impacts for
   individual persons with very low disease and treatment experience (285
   KgCO2e), escalating to very high impacts (approximately 2,170 KgCO2e)
   for people with high levels of disease and treatment experience. SUP
   waste follows a similar linear rise across the different cohorts of
   dental experience over a lifetime (6-50 years), from 1,382 items and 4.6
   Kg for patients in a the very low dental experience, to 12,200 items and
   33.8 Kg for patients in the cohort of very high dental experience.
   Conclusions: The provision of all oral healthcare carries an
   environmental impact in the form of carbon footprint and SUP waste. The
   cumulative lifetime environmental impact of oral healthcare is
   proportional to the disease and treatment experience of the individual
   person for these preventable diseases; with a x8 difference between the
   two extremes of experience. Clinical Significance: All forms of oral
   healthcare have an environmental impact. The most effective way to
   mitigate these impacts is through the promotion and provision of
   effective evidence-based preventive oral healthcare.},

Title = {Harnessing total chemical-free paper and packaging materials barrier
   properties by mechanical modification of cellulosic fibers for food
   security and environmental sustainability},
Journal = {APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY},

Abstract = {Surging interest in finding sustainable alternatives for single-use
   plastics has galvanized research into cellulosic fiber-based paper and
   packaging materials. This investigation examines mechanical (refining \&
   calendering) approaches to enhance paper's barrier properties comprising
   Southern bleached hardwood kraft (SBHK) and Southern bleached softwood
   kraft (SBSK) fibers. With increased refining intensity followed by
   calendering, paper thickness decreases while the apparent density
   increases. The refining process also generates more fibrils and fines,
   as reflected by reduced pulp freeness. Air resistance increases
   significantly due to denser fiber networks and reduced porosity.
   Refining also improves the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) and oil
   \& grease resistance (OGR). A 48 \% reduction in WVTR and a Kit ``9 `'
   rating for OGR were observed in SBHK paper sheets refined at 16000
   revolution. Notably, refining modifies cellulose fiber morphology,
   promoting 59 \% and 94 \% external fibrillation in SBSK and SBHK fibers,
   respectively. This change facilitates a more compact fiber arrangement,
   enhancing barrier properties. XRD patterns show an initial increase in
   cellulose crystallinity with refining, decreasing at a higher revolution
   of refining. SEM analysis reveals decreased surface roughness and pore
   fraction post-calendering, enhancing air and OGR. In a relative sense,
   hardwood fibers showed higher barrier performance than softwood fibers.
   Our work demonstrates mechanical modifications of fibers and paper web
   can effectively tune paper barrier performance such as WVTR, OGR, and
   air/oxygen resistance.},

Abstract = {Plastic pollution is a pressing global issue, necessitating a focus on
   consumer behavior to curb this problem at its source. To effectively
   promote sustainable practices, communication strategies that employ
   future visions have gained attention. This study examines the effects of
   a narrative video intervention depicting an optimistic future vision
   concerning single-use plastic bag consumption in South Africa, compared
   to a representation of the prevailing status quo. Using a preregistered
   within-subject design, we assess the psychological and emotional
   responses to two scenarios of which one is illustrating adaptive
   behaviors toward reduced plastic bag usage, and the other showcasing
   current consumption patterns. Parametric analyses revealed a shift in
   emotional states, characterized by a greater experience of positive
   emotions and a reduced experience of negative emotions following the
   exposure to the optimistic future scenario video, as compared to the
   status quo video. Moreover, engagement with the optimistic future
   scenario was associated with higher levels of perceived behavioral
   control and behavioral intentions. No significant changes were found
   regarding sense of responsibility. These findings point to the potential
   of optimistic future visions to influence individuals at psychological
   and emotional levels. This renders optimistic future vision
   communication as an effective tool for sustainable behavior change,
   particularly in relation to the sustainable use of plastic shopping
   bags.},

Abstract = {Petroleum-derived single-use plastics have dominated a range of material
   applications, including packaging and service ware (e.g., water bottles,
   food containers, and drinking straws). However, despite their
   short-lived service life, the inherent durability, and stability of
   these plastics have resulted in significant environmental accumulation
   and spill, contaminating both aquatic and land ecosystems. Consequently,
   there is a surging interest in the development of bioplastics as a
   sustainable alternative to petrochemical derived plastics that align
   with circular economy principles. Among potential materials, cellulose
   acetate (CA) showcases impressive mechanical properties, optical
   characteristics, melt processability, and compostability. However, due
   to its hygroscopic behavior, inferior barrier properties, and lack of
   dimensional stability, CA applications in the packaging industry are
   minimal. In this research, the acetylation of lignin and its use as a
   functional filler for CA matrix was studied. The impact of varying
   lignin loadings (up to 30 wt.\%) on the tensile, morphological, barrier,
   and viscoelastic properties of the resulting materials was investigated.
   A thorough characterization of the compression-molded acetylated
   lignin-CA films revealed a reduction in water uptake (by 59\% over
   baseline), up to a 41.5\% reduction in water vapor permeability, and
   enhanced tensile properties with melt flowability. In summary, the
   examined films displayed favorable characteristics for use in food and
   other packaging applications. Consequently, they serve as low carbon
   footprint, and eco-friendly substitutes for conventional
   petrochemical-based packaging materials.},

Abstract = {Background: School is an important setting for creating healthy and
   sustainable food environments. Using participatory methods, this pilot
   study examined food and packaging waste and nutrition quality within the
   school food system.
   Methods: One secondary school in Ireland participated in a waste audit.
   Eleven male students (15-17 years) participated as citizen scientists.
   Students collected waste over 1 day and documented data on waste
   categories. Nutrition labels were photographed for analysis. Students
   created a video and participated in a focus group. Quantitative data
   were summarised using descriptive frequencies. A Nutrient Profile Model
   was applied to summarise nutrition quality. The focus group discussion
   was analysed using content analysis.
   Results: Highest weights of waste were organic waste (14.2 kg), paper
   and cardboard (5.0 kg), and hard plastics (4.1 kg). Materials banned by
   the European Union Single Use Plastics Directive were found. Recycling
   bins were contaminated with food waste. Nutrition labels from 132 food
   packages were analysed, of which 115 items (87\%) were low-nutrient,
   energy dense foods. Confectionary, energy bars and desserts and savoury
   snacks were the most common packaged food groups. Students were not
   surprised by the unhealthy food choices; however, they were shocked and
   saddened at the waste practices. Their proposed solutions mapped across
   individual, community and organisational levels.
   Conclusions: The methodologies allowed successful engagement with
   students on this topic. The use of unnecessary plastics to serve food,
   poor waste separation practices, and the production of avoidable waste
   from low-nutrient, energy-dense products were key issues identified.
   Students proposed solutions that are achievable in the short-term.},

Abstract = {To implement circular production and consumption practices, tackling key
   societal concerns such as resource depletion, climate change, and
   environmental pollution is necessary. It urges the development of
   biowaste refineries as an alternative to fossil fuel-based refineries,
   which are gaining popularity globally. Numerous attempts are being made
   to encourage circular bio-economical approaches to consider food waste
   and leftover discharge transformation into value-added products. The
   valorisation of food waste has attracted substantial interest from both
   basic and applied domains due to its affordability and adaptability. The
   current review thoroughly describes the potency of converting food waste
   to create recyclable bioplastics. The rapid growth in the disposal of
   single-use plastics made from fossil fuels has created tonnes of plastic
   disposed of by humans and exacerbated the ecological imbalance. Hence,
   sustainability is achieved through the expansion of alternative
   bioplastic production. Various technologies that have been used to
   extract bioplastic from food waste are elaborated. In addition, a brief
   discussion on the factors affecting bioplastic generation along with its
   biodegradability and recyclability is provided. The economic viability,
   challenges and future scope for the production of bioplastics towards a
   sustainable bio-future are discussed in detail.},

Abstract = {Plastic waste, particularly single-use plastic products, is becoming a
   more significant environmental problem that must be mitigated
   effectively. Applying thermoplastic waste in the hot-mix asphalt
   concrete would create an alternative to recycling plastic waste before
   going to landfills. This study aims to introduce a modified Marshall mix
   design framework developed for hot-mix asphalt concrete mixed with
   recycled plastic (ACP). The Marshall mix design method was used as the
   baseline procedure for the ACP mix design development of the dry mixing
   process in which plastic was mixed directly with the hot aggregate
   instead. Two types of recycled plastic, multilayer, and mixed plastics,
   were employed in the ACP mix design development process. A new parameter
   of the plastic-to-binder ratio (PBR) and a replacement concept were
   introduced as add-on steps to the conventional Marshall mix design to
   appropriately determine an optimum amount of additional plastic and
   asphalt binder according to the developed mix design. A full series of
   laboratory tests were also conducted to compare conventional asphalt
   concrete (AC) and ACP performances. The laboratory test results
   indicated the superior performance of ACP over AC.},

Abstract = {Although bioplastics and paper straws have been introduced as
   alternatives to single-use plastic straws, their potential
   environmental, economic, and social impacts have not been analyzed. This
   study addresses this gap by designing a polylactic acid layer interface
   adhesion on cellulose paper-based (PLA-P) composite straws by a dip
   molding process. This process is simple, efficient, and scalable for
   massive production. Optimizing key manufacturing parameters, including
   ice bath ultrasonic, overlapping paper strips (2 strips), winding angle
   (60 degrees), soaking time (5 min), and drying temperature (50 degrees
   C), were systematically evaluated to improve straw quality and
   manufacturing efficiency. PLA chains were found to deposit onto the
   cellulose network through intermolecular interactions to form a
   consistent ``sandwich{''} structure, which can improve adhesion, water
   resistance, and mechanical properties. Interestingly, PLA-P straws
   effectively decomposed in soil and compost environments, with a 35-40 \%
   degradation rate within 4 months. Besides, PLA-P straw residues affected
   seed germination and plant growth, but no significant toxic effects were
   detected. Further, microplastics were observed in soil and plant tissues
   (roots, stems, and leaves), and their possible diffusion mechanisms were
   explored. The results of a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) and
   cost analysis showed that the process improvements reduced the
   ecological footprint of PLA-P straws and showed good prospects for
   commercial application. The study's findings},

Title = {High biomass filled biodegradable plastic in engineering sustainable
   composites},
Journal = {COMPOSITES PART C: OPEN ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The production of single-use, non-renewable plastic has persistently
   impacted the environment through non -biodegradable plastic
   accumulation. Injection-moulded biodegradable polymer blend
   {[}poly(butylene succinate-co-butylene-adipate) (PBSA) and poly(butylene
   adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT)] with an inexpensive filler, walnut
   shell powder (WSP), enables an appropriate melt flow behaviour after
   incorporating compatibilizer as confirmed by rheological analysis. The
   sustainable composites with 60 wt\% WSP showed a decrement of 68.4\% in
   tensile strength as compared to PBSA/PBAT blend. However, the inclusion
   of a 5 wt\% compatibilizer in PBSA/PBAT/60wt\%WSP composite increased
   tensile strength by 48.7\%, indicating improved interfacial adhe-sion.
   Further, the improvements in tensile (694\%) and flexural moduli (461\%)
   of PBSA/PBAT blend were observed with the addition of 60 wt\% WSP in
   presence of 7 wt\% compatibilizer due to fibrillar morphology of filler.
   Thus, signifying enhanced stiffness with increased filler, leading to a
   composite suitable for rigid pack-aging. Scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) confirmed an improved adhesion between matrix and filler
   interfaces with the addition of a compatibilizer as gaps decreased,
   subsequently leading to increased mechanical properties. The novelty of
   this work establishes a high loading of filler can be incorporated with
   biodegradable polymers and improved properties in presence of
   compatibilizer makes it more suitable for injection moulding
   applications to produce a low-cost biocomposite capable of being used as
   a single-use plastic alternative in rigid packaging.},

Title = {Using counterintuitive sustainability examples in teaching life cycle
   assessment: A case study},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION \& RECYCLING ADVANCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {19},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Popular media has reinforced ideas of what products are or are not
   environmentally detrimental, often only considering a fraction of the
   overall product life cycle, such as the end of life for single use
   products, or a single environmental consideration. This leads to
   counterintuitive sustainability examples, where a product is commonly
   thought to be much more environmentally impactful than its counterparts,
   but that actually is not universally true. Single use plastic drinking
   straws are one such example, which were used as the course project in a
   project based life cycle assessment (LCA) course. Students' perceptions
   of which straws were the best and worst for the environment were
   surveyed both before and after the course, in order to see first the
   effect of the popular media on the initial ranking and second how the
   ranking changed after completion of the course project. Reflections on
   the course experience were also utilized to gauge how the students'
   understanding of both LCA and sustainability changed as a result of the
   course. In general, students' understanding of which straw option had
   the greatest and least environmental impact changed as a result of the
   course, in particular enabling a more nuanced view of environmental
   impact. The guided student reflections indicated four major areas of
   focus regarding the relationship between sustainability and LCA: LCA as
   revealing truth, LCA for decision making, single use products are not
   always the most environmentally impactful, and using LCA to change their
   concept of what is sustainable.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND WASTE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 has severe problems in the world with both public and
   economic health aspects. Therefore, the potential for virus transmission
   through various media needs to be anticipated in various ways, such as
   IoT-based monitoring systems, quarantine/lockdown and social distancing
   policies. These policies have an impact on waste conditions in the right
   region. This article is intended to find out how to transfer SARS-CoV-2
   through domestic and non-domestic waste media. Besides, study the
   policies taken from an area at the SARS-CoV-2 meeting on their waste
   management. The results of literature studies that have been carried out
   related to the use of online media increased following the
   implementation of social distancing policies. Disposable plastic and
   cardboard waste that is often used as food wrappers are increasing.
   Disposable medical waste as personal protective equipment also increases
   the incineration capacity to stabilise the infectious waste. Various
   countries have issued various waste management strategies during the
   pandemic. However, future studies are needed to evaluate the management
   system's effectiveness that is free of viruses and does not become a
   time-bomb in the mass spread of viruses through waste.},

Abstract = {This paper is a summary report prepared by WWF that stated how the
   plastic pollution is affecting the global ocean, the impacts are on
   marine species and ecosystems, and how these trends are likely to
   develop in future. The paper explains a serious and rapidly
   deterioration condition that needs instant and intensive international
   action. 1) Common definitions, methods, standards and regulations for an
   effective and organized global effort to combat plastic pollution
   throughout the plastic life cycle, including specific circularity
   requirements and prohibitions for certain plastic products that pose
   elevated risks to the environment. such as some single-use plastic
   products or intentionally added microplastics. 2) A clearly formulated
   vision to eliminate the direct and indirect entry of plastics into
   nature, based on the precautionary principle and the recognition of the
   devastating impacts of plastic pollution. 3) Several key global
   regions-including areas in the Mediterranean, the East China and Yellow
   Seas and Arctic sea ice-have already exceeded plastic pollution
   thresholds beyond which significant ecological risks can occur, and
   several more regions are expected to follow suit in the coming years.},

Title = {Reducing plastic waste in intensive care from longer use of intravenous
   administration and invasive monitoring sets: A before-and-after study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {84},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Introduction: Intensive care unit (ICU) treatment carries a large
   environmental burden. Extending routine replacement of plastic line sets
   that belong to intravenous administration or invasive monitoring might
   lower waste from single-use plastics in ICUs. We extended the routine
   replacement interval of line sets from 4 to 7 days and assessed plastic
   waste reduction. Methods: In this single center retrospective study the
   extension of the time interval from 4 to 7 days for routine replacement
   of line sets and its effect on plastic waste was assessed. The
   intervention was done at the start of 2022. Secondary outcomes were
   catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI), nursing workload, costs
   and material durability. Results: In total 1221 patients were admitted
   to ICU; 636 in the pre-intervention period and 585 in the
   postintervention period. There was a reduction of 881 replacement sets,
   182 kg of waste and 96 nursing hours in 2022. There was no difference in
   CRBSI incidence. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the benefits of
   7-day replacement intervals for intravenous administration and invasive
   monitoring sets. We established this in terms of waste reduction,
   patient safety and costs.},

Abstract = {The global production and consumption of plastics, as well as their
   deposition in the environment, are experiencing exponential growth. In
   addition, mismanaged plastic waste (PW) losses into drainage channels
   are a growing source of microplastic (MP) pollution concern. However,
   the complete understanding of their environmental implications
   throughout their life cycle is yet to be fully understood. Determining
   the potential extent to which MPs contribute to overall ecotoxicity is
   possible through the monitoring of PW release and MP removal during
   remediation. Life cycle assessments (LCAs) have been extensively
   utilized in many comparative analyses, such as comparing petroleum-based
   plastics with biomass and single-use plastics with multi-use
   alternatives. These assessments typically yield unexpected or
   paradoxical results. Nevertheless, there is still a paucity of reliable
   data and tools for conducting LCAs on plastics. On the other hand, the
   release and impact of MP have so far not been considered in LCA studies.
   This is due to the absence of inventory-related data regarding MP
   releases and the characterization factors necessary to quantify the
   effects of MP. Therefore, this review paper conducts a comprehensive
   literature review in order to assess the current state of knowledge and
   data regarding the environmental impacts that occur throughout the life
   cycle of plastics, along with strategies for plastic management through
   LCA.},

   and community participation: The case study of cultural tourism
   destination in Nan, Thailand},

Abstract = {Tourism expansion has led to increased municipal solid waste (MSW)
   generation, which can exacerbate environmental and societal problems if
   proper waste management systems are not implemented. The study develops
   a framework for implementing bio-based solutions (BbS) for MSW
   management in a cultural tourism destination, using the walking street
   in Nan, Thailand, as a case study. Four low-carbon waste management
   scenarios were assessed, including increasing recycling rates (RE),
   using food waste as animal feed (BbS1), using bagasse containers as a
   soil conditioner (BbS2), and substituting single-use plastics with
   bamboo products (BbS3). Results showed that the BbS1 scenario had the
   highest performance in greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, reducing 66.3 t
   CO2e/year, followed by BbS2, RE, and BbS3 scenarios, which reduce GHG by
   about 12.3, 11, and 1 t CO2e/year, respectively. However, the BbS2
   scenario has an additional benefit in returning around 84 kg N/year to
   the soil. Implementing the combination of RE, BbS1, BbS2, and BbS3
   reduced waste to landfills by about 25.5 t MSW/year and reduced GHG
   emissions by 90.3 t CO2e/year. Enhancing residual waste management is
   recommended, which can lead to mitigation of about 164.3 t CO2e/year, or
   83 \% GHG emissions reduction compared to the base case.},

Title = {Impacts associated with the plastic polymers polycarbonate, polystyrene,
   polyvinyl chloride, and polybutadiene across their life cycle: A review},

Abstract = {Polymers are the main building blocks of plastic, with the annual global
   production volume of fossil carbon-based polymers reaching over 457
   million metric tons in 2019 and this figure is anticipated to triple by
   2060. There is potential for environmental harm and adverse human health
   impacts associated with plastic, its constituent polymers and the
   chemicals therein, at all stages of the plastic life cycle, from
   extraction of raw materials, production and manufacturing, consumption,
   through to ultimate disposal and waste management. While there have been
   considerable research and policy efforts in identifying and mitigating
   the impacts associated with problematic plastic products such as
   single-use plastics and hazardous chemicals in plastics, with national
   and/or international regulations to phase out their use, plastic
   polymers are often overlooked. In this review, the polymer dimension of
   the current knowledge on environmental release, human exposure and
   health impacts of plastic is discussed across the plastic life cycle,
   including chemicals used in production and additives commonly used to
   achieve the properties needed for applications for which the polymers
   are generally used. This review focuses on polycarbonate, polystyrene,
   polyvinyl chloride, and polybutadiene, four common plastic polymers made
   from the hazardous monomers, bisphenol, styrene, vinyl chloride and
   1,3-butadiene, respectively. Potential alternative polymers, chemicals,
   and products are considered. Our findings emphasise the need for a whole
   system approach to be undertaken for effective regulation of plastics
   whereby the impacts of plastics are assessed with respect to their
   constituent polymers, chemicals, and applications and across their
   entire life cycle.},

Title = {Effect of Starch and Paperboard Reinforcing Structures on Insulative
   Fiber Foam Composites},

Abstract = {Single-use plastic foams are used extensively as interior packaging to
   insulate and protect items during shipment but have come under
   increasing scrutiny due to the volume sent to landfills and their
   negative impact on the environment. Insulative compression molded
   cellulose fiber foams could be a viable alternative, but they do not
   have the mechanical strength of plastic foams. To address this issue, a
   novel approach was used that combined the insulative properties of
   cellulose fiber foams, a binder (starch), and three different
   reinforcing paperboard elements (angular, cylindrical, and grid) to make
   low-density foam composites with excellent mechanical strength.
   Compression molded foams and composites had a consistent thickness and a
   smooth, flat finish. Respirometry tests showed the fiber foams
   mineralized in the range of 37 to 49\% over a 46 d testing period. All
   of the samples had relatively low density (Dd) and thermal conductivity
   (TC). The Dd of samples ranged from 33.1 to 64.9 kg/m3, and TC ranged
   from 0.039 to 0.049 W/mk. The addition of starch to the fiber foam
   (FF+S) and composites not only increased Dd, drying time (Td), and TC by
   an average of 18\%, 55\%, and 5.5\%, respectively, but also dramatically
   increased the mechanical strength. The FF+S foam and paperboard
   composites had 240\% and 350\% higher average flexural strength (sigma
   fM) and modulus (Ef), respectively, than the FF-S composites. The FF-S
   grid composite and all the FF+S foam and composite samples had equal or
   higher sigma fM than EPS foam. Additionally, FF+S foam and paperboard
   composites had 187\% and 354\% higher average compression strength (CS)
   and modulus (Ec), respectively, than the FF-S foam and composites. All
   the paperboard composites for both FF+S and FF-S samples had comparable
   or higher CS, but only the FF+S cylinder and grid samples had greater
   toughness (omega c) than EPS foam. Fiber foams and foam composites are
   compatible with existing paper recycling streams and show promise as a
   biodegradable, insulative alternative to EPS foam internal packaging.},

Abstract = {The increase of microplastic contamination in Vietnam is a growing
   concern due to various domestic, agricul-tural, and industrial
   activities. The use of plastic mulch and sludge application in
   agricultural farmland, textile production, daily consumer items,
   cleaning agents, and health/personal care products contribute
   significantly to the increasing microplastic pollution in the aquatic
   ecosystem. The concentration of microplastics reported in surface water
   ranged from 0.35 to 519,000 items m  3 , with fibers and fragments
   being the most prevalent shapes. Notably, the high concentration of
   microplastics was observed in lakes, canals, and megacities such as Ha
   Noi and Ho Chi Minh City, which poses potential health risks to the
   local community via drinking-water supply and food chains. As an
   emerging pollutant, MPs are the transport vectors for contaminants in
   environmental matrices that act as a carrier of hazardous pollutants,
   release toxic compounds, and evenly aggregate/accumulate in biota.
   Recent studies have reported the presence of microplastics in various
   marine organisms, including fish and shellfish, highlighting the risk of
   ingestion of these particles by humans and wildlife. Thus, it is
   imperative to monitor microplastic contamination in the ecosystem to
   provide helpful information for the government and local communities.
   Efforts should be taken to reduce microplastic pollution at the source
   to minimize potential effects on ecological and health safety. This
   review paper emphasizes the urgent need for further research on
   microplastic pollution in Vietnam and highlights potential solutions to
   mitigate this emerging environmental threat.},

Abstract = {The excessive presence of single-use plastics is rapidly degrading our
   natural environment on a global scale due to their inherent resistance
   to decomposition. Wet wipes used for personal or household purposes
   contribute significantly to the accumulation of plastic waste. One
   potential solution to address this problem involves developing
   eco-friendly materials that possess the ability to degrade naturally
   while retaining their washing capabilities. For this purpose, the beads
   from sodium alginate, gellan gum, and a mixture of these natural
   polymers containing surfactant were produced using the ionotropic
   gelation method. Stability studies of the beads by observing their
   appearance and diameter were performed after incubation in solutions of
   different pH values. The images showed that macroparticles were reduced
   in size in an acidic medium and swelled in solution of pH-neutral
   phosphate-buffered saline. Moreover, all the beads first swelled and
   then degraded in alkaline conditions. The beads based on gellan gum and
   combining both polymers were the least sensitive to pH changes. The
   compression tests revealed that the stiffness of all macroparticles
   decreased with the increasing pH of the solutions in which they were
   immersed. The studied beads were more rigid in an acidic solution than
   in alkaline conditions. The biodegradation of macroparticles was
   assessed using a respirometric method in soil and seawater. It is
   important to note that the macroparticles degraded more rapidly in soil
   than in seawater.},

Abstract = {Plastic waste is an outstanding environmental thread. Poly(ethylene
   terephthalate) (PET) is one of the most abundantly produced single-use
   plastics worldwide, but its recycling rates are low. In parallel,
   additive manufacturing is a rapidly evolving technology with
   wide-ranging applications. Thus, there is a need for a broad spectrum of
   polymers to meet the demands of this growing industry and address
   post-use waste materials. This perspective article highlights the
   potential of designing microbial cell factories to upcycle PET into
   functionalized chemical building blocks for additive manufacturing. We
   present the leveraging of PET hydrolyzing enzymes and rewiring the
   bacterial C2 and aromatic catabolic pathways to obtain high-value
   chemicals and polymers. Since PET mechanical recycling back to original
   materials is cost-prohibitive, the biochemical technology is a viable
   alternative to upcycle PET into novel 3D printing materials, such as
   replacements for acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. The presented hybrid
   chemo-bio approaches potentially enable the manufacturing of
   environmentally friendly degradable or higher-value high-performance
   polymers and composites and their reuse for a circular
   economy.One-Sentence Summary Biotransformation of waste PET to

Abstract = {The improper management of food waste (FW) in developing nations causes
   environmental and hygienic problems and is a major threat to sustainable
   development. It is projected that the production of FW will increase by
   33\% globally over the next 10 years, resulting in an estimated 1.6
   billion tons of waste per year and an economic loss of \$1.2 trillion,
   with between 50 and 60\% coming from post-consumer sources. Moving from
   a linear to a circular economy, where waste is a resource for new
   products like fuels and chemicals, is essential to achieving sustainable
   waste management. The results of 119 studies published between 2010 and
   2024 are compiled in this study, which offers a thorough examination of
   FW recycling options. These possibilities include the three thermal
   treatment processes-combustion, pyrolysis, and gasification-that can
   yield biofuels and biochar. The possibility of converting FW into
   biofuels, biofertilizers, charcoal, and bioplastics through biological
   and biochemical processes is also investigated. This study is novel in
   that it emphasizes decentralized, regionally-specific approaches to
   managing packaging waste, especially single-use plastics, and connects
   FW valorization to the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the
   United Nations (UN).},

Title = {Meso- and micro-plastics contamination of water, sediments and fish
   species in coastal communities of Ondo State, Nigeria},

Abstract = {Small plastic particles are contaminants of increasing concern in the
   environment due to the dangers they pose to organisms and their
   potential to enter human food chain. Plastic pollution of Coastal
   environments is a threat to biodiversity of aquatic resources, and to
   the health and livelihood of Coastal inhabitants. In this study,
   microplastics and mesoplastics were jointly determined in the water,
   sediments and fish species from five coastal communities in Ondo State,
   Nigeria. The plastic particles ranged from 1430 to 2844 particles/L and
   2497-4844 particles/kg in the coastal waters and sediments,
   respectively. Attenuated total reflectance- Fourier transform infrared
   (ATR - FTIR) spectroscopic analyses led to the identification of eight
   (8) plastic polymer types, with low density polyethylene (LDPE) and
   polypropylene (PP) jointly constituting 64 \% of the plastic particles
   (0.5-25 mm). Microplastics were discovered in the gastro-intestinal
   tract (GIT) of every single individual of the four (4) species
   investigated. Clarias gariepinus had the highest concentration (13.3 +/-
   3.4 microplastics/individual) and showed tendency to accumulate
   microplastics as the fish size increased. Small plastic fibres were the
   most abundant shape in the coastal environment and in the fish species,
   pointing to the impact of artisanal fishing activities in the area.
   Detection of microplastics in all the fish species implies a risk of
   exposure to plastic particles by humans, who rely on these fishes for
   their protein source. Regulation of some single-use plastics (e.g.
   nylons, polybags and styrofoams) is proposed to curb the incidence of
   plastic particles in the Nigerian total environment.},

   overview of the truly-effective strategies and related benefits},

Abstract = {Circular Economy (CE) is considered a possible solution to mitigate the
   environmental externalities of the tourism industry, with a view to more
   sustainable tourism by reducing environmental, social, and economic
   burdens in an integrated holistic approach. Moreover, the role of CE in
   tourism is highlighted by the possibility of achieving all sustainable
   development goals (SDGs) directly and indirectly using the links that
   connect SDG 12 with the others.<br /> From this point of view, this
   literature review was aimed at discussing the key strategies of CE
   applied to the tourism industry, focussing on the widespread problems of
   single-use plastic, excess food, and water consumption. The
   environmental and socio-economic benefits deriving from the application
   of the CE principles to waste management will be shown, by contributing
   to meeting all the SDGs. Many strategies have been proposed to make
   tourism circular and sustainable, and research revealed that those are
   mainly based on the concepts of reduce, reuse, recycle, and recover.<br
   /> This article confirmed the importance of - and the need for -
   research on CE in the tourism sector; further, by contributing to
   expanding research in this content area, it can stimulate the
   development and application of solutions that make the industry more
   efficient and resilient. This study was also conceived to raise the
   awareness of tourism stakeholders on the importance of CE to mitigate
   the negative externalities of the sector.},

Title = {Plastic alternatives and substitutes in the packaging sector - A UK
   consumer perspective},

Abstract = {Alternative and substitute materials to conventional plastic packaging
   offer a range of potential opportunities to help reduce the
   environmental impacts of single -use plastic. Policymakers and industry
   stakeholders are currently debating measures to address the plastic
   pollution crisis globally, but successful implementation of new policies
   or packaging technologies will require understanding of consumer
   perspectives and consumer acceptability. The present study aimed to
   examine consumer perceptions around plastic alternatives and substitutes
   by employing a life cycle approach. The Kano model of consumer
   satisfaction was used to investigate how UK consumers (n = 1177)
   responded to a variety of environmentally relevant attributes and end
   -of -life scenarios for different types of packaging (conventional
   plastic, biodegradable plastic, and glass). These responses were further
   grouped based on sociodemographic characteristics of the consumers
   including age, gender and level of education, as well as psycho
   -environmental variables such as nature connectedness. We show that
   consumers valued recyclability or compostability of packaging as
   preferable end -of -life attributes, and that overall consumers
   considered the release of plastic packaging into the natural environment
   an unacceptable end -of -life scenario. Concerningly, this was not the
   case for packaging made of biodegradable plastic or glass, highlighting
   the potential for alternatives and substitutes to increase the
   proportion of mismanaged waste. All four consumer groups had distinct
   profiles of responses to packaging sustainability attributes and end -of
   -life scenarios: `Educated environmentalists', consisting mostly of
   female consumers, considered all of the attributes of interest to be
   important, whereas `Older, less educated coastal dwellers' showed
   similar responses but rated four out of seven sustainability attributes
   of biodegradable plastic packaging as irrelevant. `Non
   -environmentalists' perceived all attributes as irrelevant, as did
   `Nature -connected egocentrists', with the exception of glass being made
   of recycled material. Overall, our findings indicate that consumers are
   not sufficiently informed about the environmental impacts and
   opportunities around packaging, highlighting the need for appropriate
   consumer education to support policy and industry in implementing the UN
   Plastics Treaty.},

Title = {Land use and COVID-19 lockdowns influence debris composition and
   abundance in stormwater drains},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {871},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Stormwater drains act as a pathway for anthropogenic debris from land to
   sea, particularly in urbanised estuaries where impervious surfaces
   expedite the process. Debris type and abundance in stormwater drains may
   vary due to land use and human activity, and knowledge of this variation
   is necessary to manage the growing threat of debris. Surveys of
   stormwater debris can inform targeted reduction and remediation efforts
   by intercepting and identifying pollutants near their source. We
   surveyed replicate stormwater gross pollutant traps across four land use
   zones (city centre, shopping cen-tre, transportation hub, industrial
   precinct) before and during COVID-19 measures to assess the effects of
   changing human activities. Gross pollutant traps were installed in 120
   drains in Greater Melbourne, Australia, and citizen scientists trained
   by Tangaroa Blue Foundation weighed and classified debris at 6-week
   intervals between October 2019 and October 2020. Four survey cycles were
   conducted before lockdowns were implemented, then another four during
   lockdowns. COVID-19 lockdowns and patterns of debris type and abundance
   across land use revealed how changes in human activity might im-pact the
   flow of debris. Cigarette butts were the most abundant macro debris (>5
   mm) item in every survey cycle, regard-less of lockdowns. Industrial
   land use zones had the lowest macro debris counts but contained over 90
   \% of the micro debris (1-5 mm). The amount of total macro debris
   decreased during lockdowns, however the most abundant and prob-lematic
   debris items such as cigarettes and single-use plastics did not decrease
   as much as might be expected from the con-comitant reductions in human
   activity. Occupational health and safety items, such as masks and
   gloves, increased (144 \%) during COVID-19 lockdowns. Micro debris
   counts did not change in industrial zones during lockdowns, suggesting
   that workplace interventions may be necessary to reduce this debris
   leakage. Tracing the pathway of debris from source to sea can inform
   reduction and long-term management strategies.},

Abstract = {Plastic marine litter is becoming a major environmental concern.
   Microwaves (MWs) have potential for remote detection of floating
   macroplastics operating from satellites or airborne platforms, but very
   scarce and limited studies exist in the literature evaluating MW radar
   effectiveness for this purpose. First, we present the results of a
   systematic study on MW scattering of floating low-mass macroplastics at
   2-20-GHz frequency band using radar techniques. Data were first
   collected in small-scale measurement campaigns carried out in an indoor
   facility capable of producing deep sea-like wave patterns, with
   different floating single-use plastic items. The study reveals that, for
   these targets, one important scattering contribution arises from the
   indentation they produce on the water. For the tested conditions,
   targets, and metrics, it was possible to detect several types of
   floating plastic targets down to 10-g/m(2) concentration. Detection
   tended to significantly improve at the X-band, although the detection
   threshold depends on the combination of the mentioned conditions. Tests
   were also extended to two small-scale outdoor scenarios with natural
   wind and capillary waves. The detection of macroplastics was successful
   in these tested scenarios.},

Abstract = {Due to environmental concerns regarding single-use plastic materials,
   major efforts are being made to develop new material concepts based on
   biodegradable and renewable resources, e.g., wood pulp. In this study,
   we assessed two types of wood pulp fibres, i.e., thermomechanical pulp
   (TMP) and Kraft pulp fibres, and tested the performance of the fibres in
   wet-moulding and thermopressing trials. Kraft pulp fibres appeared to
   retain more water than TMP, increasing the dewatering time during
   wet-moulding and apparently increasing the compression resistance of the
   pulp during thermoforming. Additionally, cellulose nanofibres (CNF) were
   added to the pulps, which improved the mechanical properties of the
   final thermopressed specimens. However, the addition of CNF to the pulps
   (from 2 to 6\%) had a further decrease in the dewatering efficiency in
   the wet-moulding process, and this effect was more pronounced in the
   Kraft pulp specimens. The mechanical performance of the thermoformed
   specimens was in the same range as the plastic materials that are
   conventionally used in food packaging, i.e., modulus 0.6-1.2 GPa,
   strength 49 MPa and elongation 6-9\%. Finally, this study demonstrates
   the potential of wood pulps to form three-dimensional thermoformed
   products.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {408},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {To ensure sustainable seafood production for future generations, seafood
   businesses must be resilient in the face of future shocks and stresses.
   Recent research suggests that by increasing alignment with principles of
   circular economy such as eliminating waste and regenerating natural
   environments, seafood companies may be able to improve their general
   resilience (i.e. resilience to unforeseen disruptions). Research
   presented here empirically explores potential links between circular
   economy, risk mitigation and resilience through a survey and work-shops
   with seafood businesses in the United Kingdom. We found that many of the
   seafood companies partici-pating in our research are actively
   implementing a range of circular economy actions such as recycling
   materials and minimising the use of single-use plastics. When
   identifying specific risks, businesses tended to adopt short-term
   mitigation measures that were less likely than longer-term measures to
   be aligned with circular economy principles. While businesses felt
   confident about their ability to adapt to and survive future risks, a
   focus on short-term risk mitigation might reduce their capacity to plan
   for longer-term risks. An inability to identify and prepare for
   longer-term risks may also impede businesses' ability to increase their
   resilience to unforeseen disruptions and lock companies into a reactive,
   rather than a capacity-building cycle of risk mitigation.},

Title = {Perspectives on Thermochemical Recycling of End-of-Life Plastic Wastes
   to Alternative Fuels},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Due to its resistance to natural degradation and decomposition, plastic
   debris perseveres in the environment for centuries. As a lucrative
   material for packing industries and consumer products, plastics have
   become one of the major components of municipal solid waste today. The
   recycling of plastics is becoming difficult due to a lack of resource
   recovery facilities and a lack of efficient technologies to separate
   plastics from mixed solid waste streams. This has made oceans the
   hotspot for the dispersion and accumulation of plastic residues beyond
   landfills. This article reviews the sources, geographical occurrence,
   characteristics and recyclability of different types of plastic waste.
   This article presents a comprehensive summary of promising
   thermochemical technologies, such as pyrolysis, liquefaction and
   gasification, for the conversion of single-use plastic wastes to clean
   fuels. The operating principles, drivers and barriers for
   plastic-to-fuel technologies via pyrolysis (non-catalytic, catalytic,
   microwave and plasma), as well as liquefaction and gasification, are
   thoroughly discussed. Thermochemical co-processing of plastics with
   other organic waste biomass to produce high-quality fuel and energy
   products is also elaborated upon. Through this state-of-the-art review,
   it is suggested that, by investing in the research and development of
   thermochemical recycling technologies, one of the most pragmatic issues
   today, i.e., plastics waste management, can be sustainably addressed
   with a greater worldwide impact.},

Abstract = {Plastics have brought many benefits to society, but their mismanagement
   has turned them into a serious environmental problem. Today, the effects
   of plastic waste on wildlife are becoming increasingly evident. Since
   studies on plastic pollution have focused on species in marine
   ecosystems, here we review current knowledge on interactions between
   terrestrial mammals and plastic waste in the countries of the Americas,
   which is a global hotspot of mammalian biodiversity and in turn has,
   among its member countries, nations with high per capita generations of
   plastic waste globally. We identified 46 scientific articles documenting
   plastic ingestion in 37 species and four species that used plastic waste
   for nest or burrow construction. Of the 46 investigations, seven focused
   on plastic contamination, while the others reported on the presence of
   plastics in wildlife, even though this was not the primary focus of the
   research. However, these publications lack analytical methods commonly
   used in plastic studies, and only one study applied a standardized
   methodology for plastic detection. Therefore, in general, plastic
   pollution research on terrestrial mammals is limited. We extend several
   recommendations such as designing methodologies that are adapted to
   terrestrial mammals for the identification of plastics in fecal matter
   or gastrointestinal contents, carrying out species-specific analyzes on
   the impacts of plastics in nests or burrows, and giving further
   attention to this understudied issue and taxa.},

Title = {Assessment of the Impact of Superficial Contamination and

Abstract = {Single-use plastics are a matter of convenience in everyday life, with
   the majority allocated to packaging production. However, it comes with a
   high environmental price as its mass recycling is challenging due to the
   heterogeneity of composition, contaminations of different kinds, and
   degradation caused by service and processing. This study aims to
   ascertain the impact of removing contaminants from post-consumer
   recycled polypropylene (rPP) on its degradation and properties by
   implementing a systematic approach for decontamination by washing. Four
   lots of recycled plastics with different degrees of contamination were
   evaluated via Fourier transform infrared, melt flow indexer, and
   differential scanning calorimetry and tested for tensile strength.
   Degradation of the rPP was manifested by the deterioration in ductility,
   resulting in 14.58\% elongation at break (unwashed rPP) compared with
   191.41\% (virgin PP)) and a significant reduction in oxidation induction
   time. In the unwashed rPP sample, a wave intensity peak at 1730 cm(-1),
   assigned to the saturated C = 0 stretch of the carbonyl functional
   group, was detected. This peak was gradually disappearing with an
   increase in the cleaning efficiency of rPP, highlighting the role of
   contaminants as degradation catalysts. The cold-washing method showed
   similar processing and mechanical performance improvement results
   compared with the other washing methods, while being more
   environmentally friendly and energy efficient.},

Title = {Characteristics and fluxes of plastic debris based on socio-economic

Abstract = {Patos Lagoon, located in southern Brazil, is the world's largest choked
   coastal lagoon. Studies have revealed that plastic pollution affects
   lagoons; however, to date, they have only focused on a few limited
   regions of the lagoon. Top-down quantification methods based on
   socio-economic data from 2010 to 2017 were used to measure the amount of
   plastic reaching Patos Lagoon, thus broadening the perspective of
   plastic pollution in this area. According to the findings, Patos
   Lagoon's hydrographic regions produced an average of 4.54 Mton of
   plastic during the studied period. 1.86 Mton was consumed on average.
   High- and low-density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE, respectively),
   polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were the main resins
   produced. Food-related activities were the largest consumer of plastic
   (17.98\%), indicating a higher amount of single-use plastics being used
   in the basin. The preforms for plastic bottles, bags, and packaging were
   the most commonly manufactured plastic utensils. An estimated 8 to 14\%
   of all plastics used to end up as mismanaged waste in the Patos Lagoon
   hydrographic basin. This resulted in 1.73 and 10.72 Kton, or 0.5 and 3.2
   g/per person/per day, of plastic waste flowing into the waters of Patos
   Lagoon throughout the study period. These findings can help focus on
   management efforts by providing managers and policymakers with
   information for better plastic pollution mitigation in this environment.},

Abstract = {Sorghum, a widely cultivated grain, shows great potential for
   eco-friendly and innovative applications. This study focuses on
   developing sorghum-based spoons enhanced with edible flower powders
   (hibiscus and rose) and roasting techniques, offering a sustainable
   alternative to single-use plastic (SUP) spoons in the food and tourism
   industries. The spoons were standardized using a closed mold, resulting
   in a 2-mm thickness, 13-cm length, and 8-g weight. Adding flower powders
   and roasting significantly improved the spoons' optical properties
   (L{*}, a{*}, b{*} values) and their micronutrient and fiber content
   compared to unprocessed versions. Sensory evaluation indicated high
   consumer acceptability, with flower-enhanced spoons scoring above 8, and
   unprocessed versions scoring 7 on a 9-point hedonic scale for
   appearance, taste, flavor, texture, and hardness. Texture analysis
   demonstrated superior strength in flower-enriched spoons (56.21 N)
   compared to roasted (34.5 N) and unprocessed (31 N) versions. Roasted
   spoons retained structural integrity in hot soups for up to 30 min,
   while flower incorporation did not affect durability or water
   absorption, and all spoons withstood a 50-cm drop test. Microbial loads
   were within safe limits (13x10(1) cfu) after 120 days, with minimal
   cytotoxicity (3 to 10\%) in the brine shrimp lethality assay.
   Additionally, the spoons were fully biodegradable within 12 days. This
   study underscores the potential of sorghum-based spoons as a
   sustainable, biodegradable alternative to conventional cutlery,
   supporting environmental conservation and reducing plastic waste.},

Title = {Evaluating citizens' willingness to participate in hypothetical
   scenarios towards sustainable plastic waste management},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {148},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Plastic waste (PW) is a global environmental problem that creates a
   formidable challenge for managers tasked with finding the optimal
   solution to the ocean's plastic pollution. Vietnam has been listed among
   the top five countries responsible for discharging large amounts of PW
   into the oceans without appropriate management and treatment. Therefore,
   research that focuses on understanding citizens' preferences towards
   sustainable PW management (PWM) in Vietnam is crucial, as such
   information will help to achieve the goal of PW reduction. This study
   applied a choice experiment to evaluate the effects on citizens'
   preferences for the reduction of plastic under different levels of
   environmental awareness, estimating the citizens' preference
   heterogeneity for a PWM program and developing PWM scenarios based on
   the results of the empirical analysis. The results indicate that
   multi-stakeholder cooperation, a policy on banning single-use plastics,
   the adoption of green life and zero-waste events, the establishment of
   waste collection stations, and the introduction of eco-friendly
   alternatives are among the most effective factors influencing PWM. It is
   also found that the following characteristics affect the citizens'
   preferences for PWM program, namely: 1) citizens' awareness of the
   impact of plastics on the environment, 2) citizens' education level, and
   3) citizens' living areas. Furthermore, this study suggests four PWM
   scenarios, which were built from the positive-preference attributes, for
   application in decision-making in countries without adequate PWM
   policies and infrastructure. These outcomes are expected to be a useful
   reference for developing policy and management strategies in the near
   future, which can mitigate the PW pollution.},

Title = {Realist Review and System Dynamics as a Multimethod Qualitative
   Synthesis Approach for Analyzing Waste Minimization in Aotearoa New
   Zealand},
Journal = {SYSTEMS},

Abstract = {Many of society's most pressing problems, such as climate change,
   poverty, and waste, are categorized as ``wicked{''} problems because
   they are seemingly resistant to change. Interventions designed to
   address these problems can produce unintended consequences, which then
   perpetuate the problem. Evaluating the effectiveness of such
   interventions is challenging and requires understanding of the social
   systems in which the problems are embedded. Multimethodology approaches
   can support such holistic understanding by combining different
   methodologies which complement and overlap with each other. This article
   reports on a study that combined two different methodologies-realist
   review and qualitative system dynamics. The result was a program theory
   for waste minimization interventions in Aotearoa New Zealand and a
   causal loop diagram, which allowed us to identify potential leverage
   points for change. The two methodologies highlighted different aspects
   of the problem in complementary ways. For example, the first program
   theory proposition emphasized the important role of people who were
   critically conscious of the need for sustainability, while the causal
   loop diagram showed that there needed to be enough critically conscious
   people for change to be embedded in the system. The program theory's
   third and fourth propositions noted the important role of leadership and
   resource allocation in shifting interventions away from waste management
   initiatives, such as recycling plastic bags, towards waste minimization
   initiatives, such as banning single-use plastic bags. The causal loop
   diagram demonstrated why resource allocation to waste management
   initiatives, such as recycling, are not effective in addressing the
   overall problem of waste by showing the feedback loops that operate in
   the system. Such insights show that realist reviews and qualitative
   system dynamics can usefully complement each other for greater
   understanding of wicked problems.},

Abstract = {Plastic pollution and microplastic (MP, 1 mu m to 5 mm) generation are
   growing problems affecting the global community and a wide range of
   natural and disturbed environments. Urban and suburban waterways are
   directly impacted by plastic pollution due to their proximity to
   population centers and many different types single use plastic waste
   sources. In this study, plastic waste accumulation and fragmentation was
   investigated along the Cooper River in Camden County, NJ. Polymer
   composition was identified for individual plastic waste particles
   collected along the Cooper River using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
   spectrometry. Multiple human-built structures (Wallworth Lake, Evans
   Pond and Hopkins Pond dams) along the Cooper River were found to
   accumulate different types of plastic waste. The accumulation of plastic
   waste along these structures resulted in the initial stages of plastic
   fragmentation and the identification of large MP particles (1 to 5 mm).
   Quantitative analysis revealed that fragmented polystyrene (PS)
   particles constituted 82.8\% of the total plastic fragments identified,
   most of which were identified at the Wallworth Lake dam. Many other
   types of fragmented plastic litter, including polyethylene and
   polypropylene, were identified at the Wallworth Lake dam, as well. This
   research demonstrates that engineered structures within urban and
   suburban aquatic ecosystems serve as significant aggregators of plastic
   debris, thereby catalyzing its breakdown into microplastics. Considering
   the escalating ecological and human health ramifications of microplastic
   proliferation, the fragmentation of plastic waste in an urban and
   suburban waterway observed in this study can also result in potentially
   toxic smaller MP particles, and increased exposure to aquatic organisms
   and humans.},

Title = {A comprehensive review of micro- and nano-plastics in the atmosphere:
   Occurrence, fate, toxicity, and strategies for risk reduction},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {904},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Micro- and nano-plastics (MNPs) have received considerable attention
   over the past 10 years due to their environmental prevalence and
   potential toxic effects. With the increase in global plastic production
   and disposal, MNP pollution has become a topic of emerging concern. In
   this review, we describe MNPs in the atmospheric environment, and
   potential toxicological effects of exposure to MNPs. Studies have
   reported the occurrence of MNPs in outdoor and indoor air at
   concentrations ranging from 0.0065 items m(-3) to 1583 items m(-3).
   Findings have identified plastic fragments, fibers, and films in sizes
   predominantly <1000 mu m with polyamide (PA), polyester (PES),
   polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), rayon,
   polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC),
   polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) as the major
   compounds. Exposure through indoor air and dust is an important pathway
   for humans. Airborne MNPs pose health risks to plants, animals, and
   humans. Atmospheric MNPs can enter organism bodies via inhalation and
   subsequent deposition in the lungs, which triggers inflammation and
   other adverse health effects. MNPs could be eliminated through source
   reduction, policy/regulation, environmental awareness and education,
   biodegradable materials, bioremediation, and efficient air-filtration
   systems. To achieve a sustainable society, it is crucial to implement
   effective strategies for reducing the usage of single-use plastics
   (SUPs). Further, governments play a pivotal role in addressing the
   pressing issue of MNPs pollution and must establish viable solutions to
   tackle this significant challenge.},

Title = {Fishing plastic waste: Knowns and known unknowns},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {205},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Plastics entering the marine environment primarily originate from
   land-based sources, prompting significant attention on single-use
   plastic packaging. However, fishing plastic waste also contributes
   substantially to marine plastic pollution, though it is often overlooked
   in the literature due to the challenges in pinpointing pollution
   sources. This study addresses this key knowledge gap by synthesizing
   existing literature to explore and document the knowns and known
   unknowns surrounding fishing plastic waste's environmental, health, and
   socio-economic impacts. Through the development of a causal loop
   diagram, the study offers a preliminary understanding of the issue,
   serving as a foundation for a deeper exploration of the complexities
   within the fishing industry's plastic waste dynamics. Finally, the study
   highlights that short-sighted views and approaches are likely to lead to
   systemic failures. Therefore, it advocates for strategic and meaningful
   measures to tackle marine plastic pollution, emphasizing the critical
   importance of a holistic and integrated understanding of the various
   plastic waste streams infiltrating and polluting our oceans.},

Title = {Bottling it? Consumer responses to less environmentally friendly
   products: A choice experiment for water in plastic packaging in the UK},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {373},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Consumers have several options when confronted with less environmentally
   friendly packaging like water in single use plastic bottles - they can
   ignore environmental concerns and proceed with a purchase, refuse to buy
   any such product, seek out a less damaging version like water in
   biodegradable bottles, and/or engage in offsetting/compensatory behavior
   such as donating to a charity. Understanding how consumers value these
   options is an important academic and management challenge. To address
   this, a stated choice experiment is employed. It considers the
   preferences of a representative sample of UK consumers for bottled water
   with the attributes: packaging (PET versus biodegradable), charity
   donation (environment/social/none), origin (domestic/foreign), and
   price. Data were analyzed using random parameter logit modeling,
   incorporating a latent variable into the model, which captured
   environmentally conscious behavior. Based on the model estimations,
   domestic origin, biodegradable packaging, and charity donations (both
   for environmental and social causes) positively affect decision-makers'
   perceived utility. In keeping with moral consistency theory, as
   consumers' level of nature relatedness and green consumption values
   increase, biodegradable packaging becomes more preferable than
   nonbiodegradable packaging, and the likelihood of refusing to purchase
   any bottled water option, rises, respectively. In contrast, high levels
   of materialist values are associated with lower environmental
   consciousness. The paper provides evidence to managers regarding
   consumers' valuation of more environmentally friendly packaging, and
   strategies to increase uptake.},

Abstract = {The usage and disposal of highly abundant single-use and multilayered
   plastics contribute to significant ecological problems. The
   thermochemical recovery of these plastics to useful products and
   chemicals provides opportunity for positive economic and environmental
   impacts. Most previous research use idealised and unrepresentative
   feedstocks. To address this, various mixed waste plastics collected from
   the rejected fraction of a municipal waste recovery facility in Ghana
   were pyrolyzed at varying temperatures of 450, 500 and 550 degrees C and
   their yields compared. The obtained chemical products were analysed
   using several different techniques. Energy and carbon balances of the
   processes were produced using the CHNS and energy content of the oil
   fraction and the compositional results of the pyrolysis gas fraction,
   the latter of which was measured by Gas Chromatography Thermal
   Conductivity Detection (GC-TCD). The oils were further assessed via Gas
   Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify the available
   valuable compounds. The formed oil contained approximately 40\% light
   hydrocarbons (C6 - C11), 18\% middle hydrocarbons (C11 - C16) and 42\%
   heavy hydrocarbon compounds (C16+). The optimal oil yield of 65.9 +/-
   0.5\% and low heating value of 44.7 +/- 0.1 MJ/kg for single-use
   plastics were recorded at highest heating temperatures of 550 and 500
   degrees C, respectively. The findings provide indication that pyrolysis

Title = {A review of plastic debris in the South American Atlantic Ocean coast -
   Distribution, characteristics, policies and legal aspects},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {938},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {The presence of plastics in the oceans has already become a pervasive
   phenomenon. Marine pollution by plastics surpasses the status of an
   emerging threat to become a well-established environmental problem,
   boosting research on this topic. However, despite many studies on the
   main seas and oceans, it is necessary to compile information on the
   South American Atlantic Ocean Coast to identify the lack of research and
   expand knowledge on marine plastic pollution in this region.
   Accordingly, this paper conducted an in-depth review of monitoring
   methods, sampling, and identification of macroplastics and microplastics
   (MPs) in water, sediments, and biota, including information on legal
   requirements from different countries as well as non-governmental
   initiatives. Brazil was the country with the highest number of published
   papers, followed by Argentina. MPs accounted for 75 \% of the papers
   selected, with blue microfibers being the most common morphology,
   whereas PE and PP were the most abundant polymers. Also, a lack of
   standardization in the methodologies used was identified; however, the
   sites with the highest concentrations of MPs were the Bahia Blanca
   Estuary (Argentina), Guanabara Bay (Brazil), and Todos os Santos Bay
   (Brazil), regardless of the method applied. Regarding legislation,
   Uruguay and Argentina have the most advanced policies in the region
   against marine plastic pollution due to their emphasis on the life cycle
   and the national ban on certain single-use plastics. Therefore,
   considering its content, this expert review can be useful to assist
   researchers dealing with plastic pollution along the South American
   Atlantic Ocean Coast.},

Abstract = {PURPOSE: Plastic waste management must be pursued, one method is through
   the role of the community as plastic users. This study aims to evaluate
   the environmental awareness factor of the community in Makassar,
   Indonesia, as it is severely affected by plastic waste.
   DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The paper used a Structural Equation
   Modelling (SEM) analysis method with nine latent variables and a
   probability proportional size cluster sampling system. LIMITATION: The
   study is limited to Makassar City, potentially affecting the
   generalisability of its findings. Future research should explore
   cross-border plastic waste issues and implement practical solutions,
   such as Mangrove-Bin technology, to address waste in diverse regions and
   enhance the effectiveness of waste management strategies. FINDINGS: This
   study found that knowledge is essential and should be worked together
   with an attitude towards tackling plastic waste in general and
   post-COVID-19 pandemic in particular. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: In addition to
   technological advancement, knowledge and attitude as part of
   environmental awareness could solve plastic waste issues. Knowledge and
   attitude could also influence many people's attitudes towards plastic
   waste. PRACTICAL IMPLICATION: The study underscores the importance of
   public knowledge and attitudes towards plastic waste management,
   emphasising the role of government in promoting education and
   initiatives to reduce plastic waste. These efforts align with UN SDG 12,
   advocating for sustainable production and consumption through effective
   waste management and recycling policies.},

   review},

Abstract = {This review examines the occurrence and fate of microplastics (MPs) in
   freshwater, marine, and terrestrial environments in South Africa. MPs
   were found in Tshwane and Johannesburg in drinking water samples, with
   concentrations as high as 0.189 particles/L. Concentrations in
   freshwater bodies were greater, sometimes reaching 0.33-56 particles/L.
   MP levels in marine sediments were greater than many worldwide averages,
   particularly along the southeast coast (up to 45,867 particles/kg) and
   the MP levels in air were 1-5 particles/m3. These values are in line
   with figures around the globe which stand at 0.1-10 particles/L, and
   0.3-10 particles/m3 for water, and air respectively. Low-density PE, PP,
   and PE-HD were the most prevalent polymers identified. Although there is
   little data, inappropriate disposal of waste is a major cause of soil
   contamination, which is a serious concern. The study highlights how
   important it is to conduct more research to close knowledge gaps,
   especially regarding MPs in groundwater and their impact on human
   health. The findings emphasise the necessity of improved wastewater
   treatment technologies, public awareness initiatives, and stronger laws
   governing single-use plastics. Standardizing MPs detection techniques,
   improving our knowledge of MPs fate and transport, and estimating the
   effects of MPs exposure to human health should be the main goals for
   future research. Effective cooperation between researchers, legislators,
   and industry is necessary for mitigation initiatives to be successful.},

Abstract = {Circular polymer systems, specifically polyesters operating through
   chemical and biological technologies, are approaching a critical moment
   of industrial adoption and scale-up feasibility. At the same time,
   polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production, scale-up, and resulting material
   development is converging toward commodity applications. The current PHA
   end-of-life philosophy, however, focalizes leveraging inherent
   biodegradability to circumvent plastic waste accumulation. If indeed a
   substantial replacement of incumbent single-use plastics with PHA
   alternatives is to be met in commercial manufacture, we emphasize the
   importance of linking PHA development with feasible polymer recycling
   technologies. In other words, a PHA materials economy is significantly
   more carbon- and cost-favorable when efficient mechanical
   (reprocessing), chemical (deconstruction, depolymerization), or
   biological (enzymatic) recycling is prioritized over biodegradation or
   composting. In this perspective, we discuss strategies for PHA
   recyclable-by-design principles, guidable by developing machine learning
   tools, as well as material compatibility with closed-loop recycling
   technologies. Additionally, we posit compelling life-cycle assessment
   incentives for adopting polymer reclamation over competing pathways.
   Ultimately, we hope this narrative further inspires the alignment
   between PHA design with growing calls for a circular material economy.
   This paper discusses the scale-up feasibility and industrial adoption of
   polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), emphasizing the need to link PHA
   development with recycling technologies and highlighting strategies for
   designing PHAs for closed-loop recycling.},

Abstract = {Since monomers in backbone of poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA)
   are not entirely derived from bio-based sources, limiting its
   application in the face of increasingly stringent environmental
   policies. In this study, a novel full bio-based biodegradable random
   copolyester poly(butylene succinate-co-sebacicate-co-salicylicate) was
   successfully synthesized. Detailed investigations were conducted on the
   structural, mechanical, and degradation characteristics resulting from
   the introduction of salicylicate and sebacicate units. Introduction of
   salicylicate units effectively enhanced the mechanical performance. In
   comparison to PBSA, the tensile modulus of copolymer increased by 20.2\%
   with 10\% salicylic acid. Introduction of sebacicate units significantly
   altered the crystalline structure of copolymer and promote the
   degradation efficiency. Considering both mechanical strength and
   degradation efficiency, the copolyester with 2\% salicylic acid and 20\%
   sebacic acid was found to meet practical application requirements.
   Relative to PBSA, this copolymer demonstrated a 13.7\% increase in
   tensile modulus and a remarkable 143.1\% improvement in degradation
   efficiency. Importantly, this study focused on the effect of the
   bio-based rigid monomer salicylic acid and the soft monomer sebacic acid
   on the degradability of biodegradable polymers. The insights gained
   provide valuable guidance for tailoring the synthesis of degradable
   plastics to meet diverse degradation cycle requirements.},

Abstract = {The presence and distribution of microplastics (MPs, <5 mm) has been
   reported worldwide in the aquatic ecosystem and is identified as
   emerging pollutant that can adversely affect the health of aquatic
   environment. The production and consumption of plastics has increased
   tremendously worldwide because of their properties including pliability,
   low cost, versatility, durability, and lightweight. Currently, the
   global production of plastics exceeds 320 million tonnes (Mt) per year,
   with single-use plastic accounting for more than 40\% of this total.
   Because plastic is non-biodegradable, the majority of its annual
   production accumulates and finally enters the aquatic systems. Aquatic
   biota may suffer physical damages, fatigue, reduced appetite, blockage
   of metabolic channels, and altered feeding behavior due to consumption
   of MPs. Occurrence of MPs in air and food samples has been documented
   across the world. Thus, the MPs may also pose a great risk to the health
   of human beings, because of the human exposure to MPs and their
   concerned harmful contaminants through food chain or ingestion through
   the air. Due to the vast abundance and deleterious effects of MPs, more
   studies are focusing on MPs to estimate their dispersion, fate,
   quantity, and transport in the global aquatic systems. Through this work
   we have reviewed various analytical techniques of MPs including the
   collection of samples from surface water and sediments, identification,
   and quantification. One of the most prevalent techniques for recognizing
   MPs is visual categorization, which can be improved by combining it with
   other techniques viz. spectrometry and thermal methods. This review
   provides an insight about the following objectives: (1) the global
   occurrence and distribution of MPs, (2) the extensive analysis of
   effects of MPs on aquatic biota, and (3) the assessment of the current
   methods for MP sampling and analysis.},

Title = {Single-use take-away cups of paper are as toxic to aquatic midge larvae
   as plastic cups},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {330},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Single-use plastics and food packaging are the most common items
   polluting the environment, commonly identified in surveys and litter
   monitoring campaigns. There are pushes to ban these products from
   production and use in different regions, and to replace them with other
   materials viewed as ``safer{''} or ``more sustainable{''}. Here, we
   address the potential environmental impacts of take-away cups and lids
   used for hot and cold bever-ages, consisting of plastic or paper. We
   produced leachates from plastic cups (polypropylene), lids
   (polystyrene), and paper cups (lined with polylactic acid), under
   conditions representative of plastic leaching in the environ-ment. The
   packaging items were placed and left to leach in sediment and freshwater
   for up to four weeks, and we tested the toxicity of contaminated water
   and sediment separately. We used the model aquatic invertebrate
   Chironomus riparius and assessed multiple endpoints both on larval
   stages and on emergence to the adult phase. We observed a significant
   growth inhibition with all the materials tested when the larvae were
   exposed in contaminated sediment. Developmental delays were also
   observed for all materials, both in contaminated water and sediment. We
   investigated teratogenic effects via the analysis of mouthpart
   deformities in chironomid larvae, and observed significant effects on
   larvae exposed to polystyrene lid leachates (in sediment). Finally, a
   significant delay in time to emergence was observed for females exposed
   to paper cups leachates (in sediment). Overall, our results indicate
   that all the tested food packaging materials can have adverse effects on
   chironomids. These effects can be observed from one week of material
   leaching in environmental conditions, and tend to increase with
   increasing leaching time. Moreover, more effects were observed in
   contaminated sediment, indicating that benthic organisms might be
   especially at risk. This study highlights the risk posed by take-away
   packaging and their associated chemicals, once discarded into the
   environment.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe healthcare industry is a significant contributor to
   single-use plastic waste, particularly in the operating room (OR). This
   study aims to assess the volume of plastic waste generated during total
   hip, knee, and shoulder arthroplasty in the OR and identify areas for
   improvement.MethodA prospective transversal study at a tertiary hospital
   was conducted. All total knee arthroplasty (TKA), total hip arthroplasty
   (THA), and reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) from April to July 2021
   were included. The weight of plastic used during patient preparation,
   anaesthesia, and the surgical procedure was recorded. To calculate the
   environmental impact, a calculator generated by the United States
   Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) was used.ResultsA total of 68
   surgeries were included. The mean weight of plastic used in total was
   7.3 kg (SD 0.48), with the highest yielding procedure being TKA. It
   generated a mean of 7.63 kg (SD 0.28), followed by THA at 7.28 kg (SD
   0.43), and RSA at 6.87 kg (SD 0.47).Various scenarios were simulated to
   evaluate the potential impact of reducing plastic waste. Substituting
   plastic wrapping with recyclable materials could save 159.6 kg of CO2
   emissions per 100 prostheses. Eliminating non-essential equipment and
   adopting reusable fabric drapes also showed a significant
   potential.ResultsA total of 68 surgeries were included. The mean weight

Title = {A waste separation system based on sensor technology and deep learning:
   A simple approach applied to a case study of plastic packaging waste},

Abstract = {Plastic waste pollution is a challenging and complex issue caused mainly
   by high consumption of single-use plastics and the linear economy of
   ``extract-make-use-throw{''}. Improvements in recycling efficiency,
   behaviour changes, circular business models, and a more precise waste
   management system are essential to reduce the volume of plastic waste.
   This paper proposes a simplified conceptual model for a smart plastic
   waste separation system based on sensor technology and deep learning
   (DL) to facilitate recovery and recycling. The proposed system could be
   applied either at the source (in a smart waste bins) or in a centralised
   sorting facility. Two smart separation systems have been investigated:
   i) the one utilising 6 sensors (near-infrared (NIR), humidity,
   temperature, CO2, CH4, and a laser profile sensor) and ii) the one with
   an RGB camera to separate packaging materials based on their
   composition, size, cleanliness, and appearance. Simulations with a case
   study showed that for a camera-based sorting, Inception-v3, a DL model
   based on convolution neural networks (CNN), achieved the best overall
   accuracy (78\%) compared to ResNet-50, MobileNet-v2, and DenseNet-201.
   In addition, the separation resulted in a higher number of misclassified
   items in bins, as it focused solely on appearance rather than material
   composition. Sensor-based sorting faced limitations, particularly with
   dark colouration and organic matter entrapment. Combining the
   information from sensors and cameras could potentially mitigate the
   limitations of each individual method, thus resulting in higher purity
   of the separated fractions.},

Abstract = {Cellulose acetate with a degree of substitution (DS) of 2.5, commonly
   referred to as cellulose diacetate, has been discussed as an important
   source of microplastic in the environment, especially since it is used
   to produce cigarette filters. According to EU Single-Use Plastics
   Directive tobacco products are one of the ten most found SUP products in
   beach litter by number. However, at present only very few biodegradation
   studies with natural microbial communities in aqueous media have been
   reported. In the present study aqueous aerobic biodegradation simulation
   tests were performed on commercial materials according to international
   standards (ASTM D6691, ISO 14851 and ISO 19679) to address this bias.
   Cellulose diacetate proved to be biodegradable or showed strong
   indication to be non-persistent in freshwater (> 90\% relative
   biodegradation after 100 days at 21 degrees C), seawater (> 90\% after
   142 days at 30 degrees C) and seawater/sediment interface (> 70\% after
   360 days at 25 degrees C) under defined laboratory conditions. In
   freshwater, biodegradation of cellulose diacetate was characterized by a
   prolonged lag phase (75 days), followed by > 90\% relative
   biodegradation in a short time frame (25 days). This indicates that an
   abiotic degradation or hydrolysis to reduce the DS is not a
   pre-requisite to initiate the biodegradation of cellulose diacetate. In
   addition, it was found that the lag phase can be significantly shortened
   (from 75 to 5 days) by using pre-adapted microorganisms. In contrast to
   what could have been expected from literature our present study
   demonstrates that microorganisms can adapt to a DS as high as 2.5 and
   metabolize the material. This underlines the importance of studies with
   natural communities of microorganisms to get a more realistic idea of
   the persistence of a polymer material.},

Abstract = {The presence of petroleum-based monomers in the backbone of
   poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA) restricts its application in
   light of increasingly stringent environmental regulations. In this
   study, a novel full bio-based biodegradable random copolymer
   poly(butylene succinate-sebacicate-salicylicate-malicate) (PBSSeSa-c-M)
   was designed and synthesized. The comprehensive study encompassed the
   structural alterations, properties, and degradation resulting from the
   inclusion of salicylicate sebacicate and malicate units. The
   incorporation of salicylic acid effectively enhanced the tensile modulus
   of the copolymer, due to the effect of rigid benzene ring. Meanwhile,
   the addition of sebacic acid regulated the degradation rate. The
   introduction of malic acid significantly improved the rheological
   properties, endowing the copolymer with exceptional processability. The
   obtained high molecular weight PBSSeSa-c-M exhibited outstanding
   film-blowing processability with an intrinsic viscosity of 1.58 dL/g and
   melt flow rate of 7.34 g/10 min. The tensile modulus reaches 235.43 MPa
   that is comparable to commercial PBSA. Besides, the degradation of
   PBSSeSa-c-M reaches 18.92\% over 4 weeks, far higher than that of PBSA.
   In conclusion, this work provides a design and synthesis for a new kind
   of biodegradable copolyester that satisfies the requirement of rapid
   degradation in single-use plastics.

Title = {The lesser of two evils: Enhancing biodegradable bioplastics use to
   fight plastic pollution requires policy makers interventions in Europe},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {103},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution is a ubiquitous and universally recognized
   environmental threat, and bioplastics have emerged as a potential
   solution to this issue in the last years. Being biobased and
   biodegradable, bioplastics have a reduced carbon footprint with respect
   to plastics, and they are not expected to accumulate and fragmentate in
   the environments as plastics do. Nevertheless, some bioplastics
   drawbacks such as their slow biodegradation in engineered (i.e.,
   anaerobic digestion and composting) and natural (i.e., soil and water)
   environments have been used by sceptics to discredit bioplastics, and
   this have induced policy makers to use a precautionary approach to the
   topic (i.e., including bioplastics in the ban of single use products and
   in the count of inert materials in organic fertilizers). Using a
   simplified ecologic risk assessment analysis, this Opinion paper aimed
   to show that bioplastics that are proven to be intrinsically
   biodegradable are always a better choice than plastics. Having a
   residence time in natural environments of about 1-10 years, the
   likelihood of bioplastics causing harmful effects on living organisms is
   about 100-1000 times lower than plastics that resides thousands of years
   in the environments. Taking this into consideration, policy makers are
   asked to revise recent regulations and directives to enhance bioplastics
   diffusion and fight plastic pollution. In this sense, Single Use Plastic
   Directive 2019/904 may exclude biodegradable bioplastic items from the
   ban, and European Regulation on Fertilizers 2019/1009 may exclude
   biodegradable bioplastics residues from the count of inert materials in
   organic fertilizers. Bioplastics collection within biowastes and
   subsequent anaerobic digestion should be also favoured, in order to
   force controlled bioplastics biodegradation into biogas and reduce their
   leakage into the environment, resulting in the enhanced circularity of
   bioplastics products.},

Abstract = {In recent years handling plastic waste in an eco-friendly manner is a
   topic of interest all over the world. Few handling methods such as
   incineration and landfilling have been already tried however they cause
   Sevier impacts on the environment. Pyrolysis of waste plastic is an
   environmentally friendly method of handling plastics. The plastic waste
   can be reformed into hydrocarbon fuel through the pyrolysis process and
   utilized in Internal combustion engines to produce power and heat.
   Previous studies have shown that plastic oil made through the pyrolysis
   method has characteristics that are comparable to those of regular
   diesel oil; as a result, CI engines may run on plastic oil blends
   without requiring any engine modification. In the present work,
   single-use plastic waste was successfully converted into liquid
   hydrocarbon fuel via Red mud-assisted catalytic pyrolysis. Experiments
   were conducted on a batch-type pyrolysis reactor by fixing the
   catalyst-to-feedstock ratio as 0.1. The crude oil obtained was
   fractionated at a temperature of 150 degrees C and examined the fuel
   properties and compared against diesel. Tests were conducted on a
   computer-aided VCR DI Diesel engine operating with blends of waste
   plastic oil (10\%,20\%<bold>,</bold> and 30\% by vol.) and investigated
   the combined effect of blending ratio and compression ratio on
   performance, combustion, and emission characteristics. Results indicated
   that brake power and brake thermal efficiency and BSFC are slightly
   improved for the test fuel D80PO20 compared to diesel and other blends
   of waste plastic oil. Furthermore, CO, CO2, NOx, and HC emissions are
   found to increase with the increase in blending ratio. Based on the
   performance and emission analysis, the test fuel D80PO20 was identified
   as the best blend to substitute the diesel.},

Abstract = {Plastics offer versatility, durability and low production costs, but
   they also pose environmental and health risks due to improper disposal,
   accumulation in water bodies, low recycling rates and temporal action
   that causes physicochemical changes in plastics and the release of toxic
   products to animal health and nature. Some microorganisms may play
   crucial roles in improving plastic waste management in the future.
   Cunningamella echinulata has been identified as a promising candidate
   that remains viable for long periods and produces a cutinase that is
   capable of degrading plastic. Other recent approaches involving the use
   of microorganisms are discussed in this review. However, there does not
   seem to be a single science that is efficient or most appropriate for
   solving the problem of plastic pollution on the planet at present.
   Regulations, especially the implementation of different laws that
   address the entire plastic cycle in different countries, such as Brazil,
   the USA, China and the European Union, play important roles in the
   management of this waste and can contribute to reducing this problem. In
   the context of the transversality of the information compiled here, the
   current limitations are discussed, and an effective plan is proposed to
   reduce plastic pollution. Although it is challenging, it involves
   implementing legislation, promoting sustainable alternatives, improving
   collection and recycling systems, encouraging reuse, supporting research
   and technological innovation, promoting corporate responsibility,
   collaborating globally, raising public awareness, optimizing waste
   management and, above all, continuously monitoring the progress of
   actions based on measurable metrics.},

Abstract = {Single use plasticware (SUP) in scientific, diagnostic, and academic
   laboratories makes a significant contribution to plastic waste
   generation worldwide. Polystyrene (PS) microwell plates form a part of
   this waste. These plates are the backbone of high throughput
   colorimetric measurements in academic, research, and healthcare settings
   for detection/quantification of wide-ranging analytes including
   proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and enzyme activity. Polystyrene
   (PS) microwell plates serve as a platform for holding samples and
   reagents, where mixing initiates chemical reaction(s), and the ensuing
   color changes are quantified using a microplate reader. However, these
   plates are rarely reused or recycled, contributing to the staggering
   amounts of plastic waste generated in scientific laboratories. Here, we
   are reporting the fabrication of cellulose acetate (CA) microwell plates
   as a greener alternative to non-biodegradable PS plates and we
   demonstrate their application in colorimetric assays. These easy to
   fabricate, lighter weight, customizable, and environmentally friendly
   plates were fabricated in 96- and 384-well formats and made water
   impermeable through chemical treatment. The plates were tested in three
   different colorimetric analyses: (i) bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) for
   protein quantification; (ii) chymotrypsin (CT) activity assay; and (iii)
   alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity assay. Color intensities were
   quantified using a freely available smartphone application, Spotxel (R)
   Reader (Sicasys Software GmbH). To benchmark the performance of this
   platform, the same assays were performed in commercial PS plates too and
   quantified using a UV/Vis microplate reader. The two systems yielded
   comparable linear correlation coefficients, LOD and LOQ values, thereby
   validating the CA plate-cell phone based analytical method. The CA
   microwell plates, coupled with smart phone optical data capture, provide
   greener, accessible, and scalable tools for all laboratory settings and
   are particularly well-suited for resource- and infrastructure-limited
   environments.
   A green instrument-free approach to (bio)chemical analyses: cellulose
   acetate-based microwell plates as substitutes to plastic microwell
   plates.},

Title = {Preparation and evaluation of novel biodegradable Kombucha
   cellulose-based multi-layered composite tableware},
Journal = {INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {215},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {A huge volume of single-use plastics is used for food packaging and
   cutlery which is associated with significant negative environmental
   impacts. In this study, the facile fabrication of multilayered
   composites using kombucha cellulose (KC) intercalated with tannery
   waste-gelatin as bio-adhesive using layer-by-layer assembly followed by
   hydraulic heat compression technique is reported. The prolonged
   fermentation of Kombucha tea resulted in KC pellicle with productivity
   of 385.5 +/- 71.4 g/L and thickness of 2 +/- 0.7 cm. The purification
   process improved the crystallinity index of the KC layer from 41.17\% to
   86.2\%. Gelatin prepared using tannery trimming waste along with glucose
   at varying concentrations was used as interlayer coating between
   cellulose layers crosslinked by Maillard reactions resulting in the
   formation of biologically benevolent `melanoidins'. Heat crosslinked
   composite (S8-20 H) with 8 layers of KC held with
   gelatin-glucose-myrobalan tertiary complex exhibited a high tensile
   strength of 47.7 MPa and a flexural strength of 117.27 MPa indicating
   high mechanical stiffness with the least density value of 0.71 g/cm3.
   The hardness values of the composites were between 54 and 76.6 Shore D
   hardness. The moisture susceptibility and thermal stability of the
   composites were found to be optimum for its use as cutlery. The
   composites were shaped into spoon-like tableware, ergonomically designed
   to appease, with baked food-like color, texture, and fragrance. The
   aqueous tolerance and surface oil resistance exhibited by the tableware
   were superior to traditional wood-based cutlery. By mechanical
   disintegration, the tableware is fully recyclable as a value-added
   bio-fertilizer for effective plant growth. This work presents a
   sustainable waste-towealth approach towards the preparation of
   food-safe, environment-friendly and biodegradable substitutes for
   plastics intended for tableware applications.},

Abstract = {Most of the food-packaging materials are made from single-use plastics
   from petroleum sources, depleting the environment and adding to waste
   management issues. Natural fiber is a renewable, biodegradable
   alternative that has immense potential to be used as a food-packaging
   material. This review aims at reporting the strengths, limitations, and
   engineering considerations of the use of lignocellulosic biomass in the
   form of bags, paper, and particleboard for food-packaging applications.
   The limitations in the present application of jute bag for different
   grain storage and the technical interventions adapted are being explored
   to improve them. The recent reports about the use of lignocellulosic
   fiber pulp in functional paper development in targeting food packaging
   as the end application and further enhancement of the engineering
   parameters by reinforcement with nanofiber, nanocellulose,
   nano-hemicelluloses, and other lignocellulosic fiber components have
   been scrutinized. The additional functional characteristics added to
   conventional paper packaging due to the presence of lignin and
   hemicellulose are highlighted. The mechanical, swelling, and other
   properties of lignocellulosic particleboard, such as jute sticks, wood
   sticks, sugarcane bagasse, and others, with the aim of their application
   in the construction of rigid boxes or chests for fruit and vegetable
   transport in the increasing scenario of e-commerce are discussed.
   Challenges for the system of large-scale technological adaptation are
   analyzed, and the scope of future research is suggested.},

Abstract = {Picking up dog faeces with single use plastic bags and disposing in
   landfill is a common practice which ultimately harms the environment.
   Compostable plastic dog waste bags may help to divert these wastes from
   landfill and recover dog faeces as a compost feedstock, though little is
   known about how certified home compostable plastics behave in real world
   home compost systems. This study investigated the disintegration of
   commercially available certified home compostable plastic bags in
   outdoor home composts containing dog faeces. Two pilot trials (25 L) and
   one household trial (160 L) were conducted over 7, 15, and 9.5 months,
   respectively. Thermophilic temperatures were reached in all trials while
   moisture and pH were within optimal ranges for well managed compost
   systems. Bags showed statistically significant differences in
   disintegration. Based on final mass, none of the tested bags met the
   Australian Standard AS5810 minimum disintegration requirements of 90 \%
   mass loss of plastic fragments >2 mm, with average mass change of
   certified home compostable bags ranging from +1.51 to -81.28 \%. All
   certified industrial compostable bags showed an average mass increase of
   10.90-35.04 \% during composting. However, time series images of plastic
   fragmentation indicated some bags fully disintegrated and revealed
   residual biofilm that may have affected mass change data. Microplastic
   fragments < 2 mm and macroplastic fragments >5 mm were recovered in all
   composts. Due to the potential risks of using home compost contaminated
   with microplastics in household gardens, dog owners should avoid
   including compostable plastic bags in their home composts.},

   Proposal of a framework using neural topic modeling},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {There is growing research interest in the role of social media in the
   food industry, and its potential has yet to be fully exploited. This
   study extracted and analyzed data from Twitter, now X, (2018-2023) using
   relevant keywords related to food waste (FW), identified frequently
   discussed topics, and determined the sentiments involved in tweets. With
   the aid of neural topic modeling techniques, this study found that the
   main topics discussed in this social network include ``Food and Garden
   Waste Composting and Recycling,{''} ``Global Food Waste and
   Management,{''} ``Reducing Food Waste \& Saving Money,{''} ``Single-Use
   Plastic and Waste Management,{''} and ``Creative Uses of Leftovers in
   Meals{''}. Some of the subject categories often discussed are FW
   Environmental concerns, FW events, Leftovers management, and FW
   household management. Most subject categories are associated with
   positive sentiments, which are associated with topics like tips and
   recommendations for reducing FW. Negative sentiments are related to
   discussions around the environmental and social impacts of FW. Our study
   found a gap in knowledge and awareness of food recycling practices. Our
   study extends previous research because the analyzed messages are not
   restricted to specific geographical regions. Moreover, our study also
   used a more varied dataset in terms of user profiles and employed a
   search string that comprised a more varied set of terms, making our
   search more thorough. A comprehensive framework of discussed topics and
   associated sentiments is proposed. Our study has crucial implications
   for the design of FW reduction campaigns and interventions in social
   media.},

Title = {Analyzing the behavior of beachgoers in the city of Lima and their
   relationship with potential plastic emissions},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {170},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Beach littering is a source of marine plastic waste accumulation. This
   is particularly so in overcrowded beaches in the Global South in which
   cleaning measures are scarce or sporadic and lack of waste management
   systems can increase plastic release. In the current study we focus on
   the importance of the behavior shown by beachgoers and how their conduct
   relates to the amount of plastic that potentially ends up entering
   littoral ecosystems. Transportation services to beaches, sports, food,
   and beverage containers are analyzed through a 24-question survey
   performed to 500 beachgoers in 4 beaches (i.e., Venecia, Punta Negra,
   Punta Hermosa and San Bartolo) located in the megacity of Lima, Peru, in
   February 2022. The data obtained were then processed to understand the
   differences in behavior across different beaches. Moreover, a K-means
   algorithm was used to identify representative beachgoer profiles. The
   results showed a dichotomous behavior between two groups of beaches, in
   which the size group of beachgoers, transportation mode, accommodation,
   food consumption patterns or the use of reusable containers are some of
   the main differences between the two groups. No major differences were
   identified in terms of age distribution across the different beaches,
   but group sizes were higher in Punta Negra and Villa El Salvador. The
   K-means algorithm suggests that the surveyed population can be grouped
   into three main categories, of which two correspond mainly to higher
   socioeconomic beachgoers in the beaches of Punta Hermosa and San
   Bartolo. Overall, single use plastic for food and beverages appears as
   one of the main sources of plastic pollution across beaches and groups,
   although other sources of plastic emission should not be underestimated.
   Finally, the three beachgoer profiles identified are useful to implement
   targeted policies to minimize the environmental impacts of these
   profiles.},

Title = {Promoting menstrual cups as a sustainable alternative: a comparative
   study using a labeled discrete choice experiment},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUN 24},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution is a global issue that endangers both human health and
   the ecosystem. Although interest in sustainable alternatives to
   single-use plastics has grown, their adoption has been insufficient, and
   menstrual products are no exception. Disposable menstrual products, such
   as sanitary napkins, continue to dominate over sustainable options like
   menstrual cups (MCs). Although studies on women's perceptions and
   attitudes toward menstrual hygiene management have abounded, there is a
   lack of research on the development of promotional strategies for
   sustainable menstrual products. This study aims to fill this research
   gap by investigating consumers' decision-making process in the face of a
   real-life option regarding menstruation products. In this comparative
   study, we conducted a labeled discrete choice experiment on consumers in
   Japan (n = 1,929), Indonesia (n = 2,031), and France (n = 2,067) to
   reveal their preferences for sanitary napkins, tampons, and MCs. The
   respondents from each country were divided into three groups (one
   control group and two treatment groups with information provided). The
   results showed that in all countries, the information regarding the
   cost-effectiveness of MCs (i.e., per-use cost) was unequivocally
   significant, whereas information about their health and environmental
   benefits was not. Access to free MCs can contribute to their adoption
   and alleviation of period poverty in all countries, with a relatively
   moderate acceptance in Japan. The results also showed variations across
   countries in consumer characteristics (attitude toward menstruation,
   innovation-friendliness, and green consumption) and the use and
   perceptions of MCs. Hence, tailored promotional strategies should be
   considered for each market.},

Title = {Public awareness and perceptions of ocean plastic pollution and support
   for solutions in the United States},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JAN 19},
Abstract = {We conducted a nationally-representative survey of United States (U.S.)
   adults (n=1,960) in 2021 to gather insights on the knowledge,
   perceptions, and concerns about threats to the ocean, with a specific
   focus on plastics and microplastic pollution. Responses from the U.S.
   adult survey group were compared to a group of highly-engaged, Ocean
   Conservancy members who are very attuned to ocean issues (n=882). Ocean
   Conservancy is a U.S.-based nonprofit environmental advocacy group
   working to protect the ocean from today's greatest challenges. Plastic
   pollution was the primary ocean concern identified by both U.S. adults
   and Ocean Conservancy members, surpassing eight other threat categories
   including oil spills, chemical and nutrient pollution, and climate
   change. Broad concern was reported for both study groups about the
   impacts of ocean plastics on marine wildlife, with human health and
   coastal community impact concerns being less prominent. About half of
   U.S. adults and 90\% of Ocean Conservancy members had heard of
   microplastics. Both study groups indicated widespread support for
   microplastic pollution prevention measures in the U.S. and believed
   industry to be most responsible for taking action to address it. Ocean
   Conservancy members were generally better informed and more concerned
   about plastic pollution impacts and microplastics than U.S. adults and
   reported significantly greater levels of personal action to reduce their
   plastic footprint when compared to U.S. adults. In general, U.S. adults
   reported a willingness to refuse single-use plastics, but less
   frequently brought personal food containers to restaurants for takeout,
   or contacted local representatives or businesses about reducing plastic
   waste and pollution. Overall, our survey results provide new insights
   about public understanding of ocean threats and plastic pollution,
   willingness to participate in individual plastic-reduction actions, and
   support for needed solutions.},

Title = {Eco-Sustainability in Hospital Pharmacy: A Pilot Survey on `Going Green'},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHARMACY PRACTICE},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {Purpose: Between 2009 and 2015, the Canadian health care system was
   estimated to be responsible for 4.6\% of national carbon emissions.
   Determine awareness of and describe eco-initiatives that the department
   of pharmacy can implement to aim to reduce the carbon footprint in
   hospital pharmacy in an effort to `go green'. Methods: In a quality
   improvement initiative, pharmacy employees (i.e. pharmacists and
   pharmacy technicians) completed a cross-sectional survey designed to
   gauge willingness to `go green' at work, to identify actionable areas of
   waste, and to assess commuting practices. Results: A total of 15
   respondents completed the survey conducted March 14th -April 7th, 2022.
   Most respondents (73\%) were willing to engage in more sustainable
   practices at work. The main barriers to implementing green practices at
   work were `too time consuming' (20\%), `adds too much complexity'
   (20\%), and `cost' (16\%). For commuting, 60\% indicated the primary
   mode of transportation as `personal vehicle', where `subsidized transit'
   and was listed as the greatest incentive that could encourage a greener
   commute. The three largest areas of waste cited were `single use
   plastic' (36\%), `limited of awareness of green practices' (15\%), and
   `lights left on in empty rooms' (12\%). Conclusions: Pharmacy staff
   shared willingness to engage in more sustainable `go green' practices
   but raised challenges to do so. With the knowledge that Canada has the
   second most climate intensive health system, there is a need for future
   research to describe how hospital pharmacies can contribute

Title = {Open defaecation by proxy: Tackling the increase of disposable diapers
   in waste piles in informal settlements},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {250},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Disposable diapers are becoming increasingly popular and present an
   emerging challenge for global waste management, particularly within
   LMICs. They offer a cheap and convenient way for caregivers to manage
   child excreta; however, insufficient understanding of safe disposal
   methods, combined with limited access to waste management services
   results in hazardous disposal. Used diapers are being increasingly found
   dumped in the open environment, including in water bodies and in open
   fields, leading to faecal contamination of the envi-ronment and an
   enhanced risk of transmission of faecal-oral diseases such as cholera
   and typhoid. United Nations SDG 6 aims to end open defaecation globally
   by 2030; however, improper disposal of used diapers will hamper progress
   towards reaching this goal. In this review, we identify current trends
   in use and subsequent disposal of single use disposable diapers in
   LMICs, and critically discuss the environmental and public health
   impacts of current practices, and potential solutions to address these
   challenges. Contemporary methods for managing the disposal of single use
   diapers for communities in LMICs tend to be cost prohibitive with few
   alternative options other than dumping in the environment. Modern cloth
   diapers offer a low waste alternative to disposable diapers but often
   carry an unaffordable high upfront cost. Here, in addition to advocating
   improved efforts by govern-ments to upgrade access and quality of waste
   management services, we recommend the design and imple-mentation of
   intervention schemes aimed to increase awareness of safe and hygienic
   disposal practices for disposable diapers.},

Title = {Modeling consumer preference on refillable shampoo bottles for circular
   economy in Metro Manila, Philippines},
Journal = {CLEANER AND RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The transition to a Circular Economy (CE) depends on several factors,
   such as the implementation of circular business models. Although
   circular business models were developed, there are socio-cultural
   distinctions that need to be considered. One such distinction is the
   sachet culture of the Philippines. The country's consumers use
   single-use sachets for daily needs, including body care and hygiene. As
   the local sachet culture lead to significant waste emission to the
   ocean, designing circular business model for switching to a circular
   product (e.g., refillable shampoo bottle) is a key measure towards
   sustainable societies. The design of this business model, however, will
   need to consider consumer preference. In this sense, modeling consumer
   preference provides insights on how enterprises can design
   consumer-centric circular business models. The present study modeled
   consumer preference between single-use plastic shampoo sachet and
   refillable shampoo bottles through binary logistic regression,
   considering responses from 457 consumers of Metro Manila, Philippines.
   The independent variables used were the socioeconomic and demographic
   characteristics, product channel, and usage. The dependent variable was
   consumer preference between using sachet or refillable bottles shampoo.
   The model indicated a good fit with a McFadden R2 of 0.255. The model
   identified age, gender, education, environmental awareness, budget,
   daily use, and retailer as statistically significant independent
   variables. The variable `environmental awareness' attained the highest
   significance for socioeconomic and demographic characteristics.
   Meanwhile, the variable `retailer' attained the highest significance for
   product channel and usage. The two variables had the highest influence

   utilizing malls as the product channel and on ecolabelling of products.
   Future research works may use the model in integrating consumer
   preference on circular economy scenarios. Enterprises may also use the
   model in designing circular business models suitable for the target

Abstract = {Plastic production reached 400 million tons in 2022 (ref. 1), with
   packaging and single-use plastics accounting for a substantial amount of
   this(2). The resulting waste ends up in landfills, incineration or the
   environment, contributing to environmental pollution(3). Shifting to
   biodegradable and compostable plastics is increasingly being considered
   as an efficient waste-management alternative(4). Although polylactide
   (PLA) is the most widely used biosourced polymer(5), its biodegradation
   rate under home-compost and soil conditions remains low(6-8). Here we
   present a PLA-based plastic in which an optimized enzyme is embedded to
   ensure rapid biodegradation and compostability at room temperature,
   using a scalable industrial process. First, an 80-fold activity
   enhancement was achieved through structure-based rational engineering of
   a new hyperthermostable PLA hydrolase. Second, the enzyme was uniformly
   dispersed within the PLA matrix by means of a masterbatch-based melt
   extrusion process. The liquid enzyme formulation was incorporated in
   polycaprolactone, a low-melting-temperature polymer, through melt
   extrusion at 70 degrees C, forming an `enzymated' polycaprolactone
   masterbatch. Masterbatch pellets were integrated into PLA by melt
   extrusion at 160 degrees C, producing an enzymated PLA film (0.02\% w/w
   enzyme) that fully disintegrated under home-compost conditions within
   20-24 weeks, meeting home-composting standards. The mechanical and
   degradation properties of the enzymated film were compatible with
   industrial packaging applications, and they remained intact during
   long-term storage. This innovative material not only opens new avenues
   for composters and biomethane production but also provides a feasible
   industrial solution for PLA degradation.},

Abstract = {Several examples of bio-based, compostable polymers have reached
   commercialization over the past several decades, showing promise for
   addressing the plastics sustainability crisis. Although their
   composability minimizes the impact in landfills, employing these
   materials as single use plastics on a large scale would require
   exhaustive amounts of resources for crop production to meet current
   plastic demands. While these thermoplastics are, in principle,
   mechanically recyclable, the inability to effectively separate them from
   poly(ethylene terephthalate) impedes practical recycling programs that
   would enable their reuse. This work explores the potential advancement
   of optical sorting to enable the classification of polyester
   bioplastics. Near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectral data
   were collected for over 500 samples to be used for machine learning
   classification. Four classification schemes were investigated, including
   random forest (RF), K nearest neighbors (kNN), and principal component
   analysis (PCA) coupled with both schemes (PCA-RF and PCA-kNN).
   Prediction accuracies >92\% were demonstrated for both IR regions with
   the ability to further boost accuracy to >98\% by implementing model
   confidence thresholds. Exploration of sample attributes and their impact
   on material classification revealed that sample color and opacity have
   the largest impact on classification in the NIR region, while the MIR
   region is unimpacted. Additionally, feature importance analysis and
   feature reduction were carried out, showing that a smaller feature set
   can be implemented in optical sorters to more efficiently scan samples
   using only the most informational wavelengths. Finally, synthetic
   Gaussian noise was introduced into the sample spectra to mimic
   environmental noise to demonstrate that the classification models have
   some tolerance to external noise.},

Title = {Development of a beverage carton closure cap based on 100\% wood pulp
   fibres},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {445},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Single-use plastic products have been identified as an environmental
   challenge. When such products are not recycled, they may end up in
   nature and thus cause, e.g., marine littering. Thermoformed wood pulp
   fibre products are gaining more interest to replace fossil plastic
   products. However, beverage caps made of wood pulp fibres are
   challenging due to the hygroscopic nature of wood fibres, i.e., they
   absorb water, deform and loose functionality. Hence, the purpose of this
   study was to develop a fibre-based beverage cap that could replace
   plastic tethered cap systems. Both unbleached and bleached Kraft pulp
   and chemo-thermo-mechanical pulp (CTMP) fibres were tested in
   thermoforming trials, using tailor-made metal moulds. The results showed
   that Kraft pulp fibres formed denser structures, with more limited water
   absorption, compared to CTMP. The mechanical properties of thermoformed
   specimens were suitable for the application, i.e., the strength, modulus
   and elongation were between 32 and 36 MPa, 4-4.9 GPa and 1.6-1.9\%,
   respectively, depending on the type of pulp fibre. Additionally, in
   order to secure that the caps were functional in relevant conditions in
   contact with liquids (water or milk), the caps were surface modified by
   silylation and esterification to increase the liquid barrier. The
   results indicate that surface esterification increased the contact angle
   to 95. On the other hand, the surfacemodified caps could not entirely
   limit the liquid absorption over longer periods of time (>similar to 1
   h) when the caps were directly exposed to liquid. However, the liquid
   barrier was satisfactory when the products were exposed to increased
   relative humidity in refrigerated conditions (relative humidity >76\%
   and temperature <7 degrees C).},

Title = {Circular transformation in plastic management lessens the carbon
   footprint of the plastic industry},
Journal = {MATERIALS TODAY SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Improper management of plastics showed a significant impact on climate
   change and biodiversity loss. Around 400 million tonnes of plastic waste
   (PW) have been generated so far and are projected to be doubled by 2040.
   Despite having plastic management rules worldwide, only 12\% of PW is
   recycled and reused and the remaining waste directly enters the
   terrestrial and aquatic environment, leading to plastic pollution. It is
   noted that-1.7 GT of greenhouse gases releases into the environment
   during the pro-duction and incineration stages of plastics,
   demonstrating a higher carbon footprint and leading to climate change.
   To overcome these issues, it is mandatory to curtail single-use plastics
   from everyday use and enhance the recycling option from the production
   to disposal stages, bringing circularity to the plastic industry. This
   paper recommends limiting the use of virgin plastics from fossil carbon
   and endorsing recycling and reusing PW as a secondary resource that can
   minimize the-3.0 kg CO2 emission per kg of plastics. Further, to promote
   a low-carbon economy in the plastic manufacturing process, the CO2
   feedstock from fossil carbon can also be replaced by direct carbon
   capture and storage processes such as the power to x technology. This
   paper advocates setting up stepping milestones for a circular
   transformation in plastic industries that can reduce the carbon
   footprint by 25\% and fulfill the target of the United Nations
   Sustainable Development Goals.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Plastic pollution is a serious issue of global concern which requires an
   urgent and international response involving all relevant actors at
   different levels of the supply chain. Increasing production of single
   use plastics and the mismanagement of the resulting plastic packaging
   waste is one of the prominent reasons for this pressing environmental
   issue. Several potentially promising solutions, such as reusable,
   recyclable and compostable packaging systems exist. Many of these
   innovative approaches may contribute to achieving a circular plastic
   economy, but there is a need to categorise and collate these under
   unifying themes to facilitate the assessment and comparison of different
   strategies. The aim of this research is to analyse and categorise the
   existing solutions that tackle the plastic packaging waste problem to
   identify the archetypes of these solutions. Literature and business
   practice reviews were conducted to discover existing solutions. 200
   solutions were selected and categorised by exploring the common
   patterns. Finally, 10 archetypes and 17 sub-archetypes were introduced.
   These archetypes are: refill stations, mobile refill stations, refill at
   home solutions, prefilled packaging systems, reusable takeaway and
   delivery solutions, B2B reusable packages, packaging solutions led by
   elimination, compostable and biodegradable packaging, substitution to a
   non-plastic material and plastic recycling. The findings led to the
   development of an upstream packaging strategies framework. This paper
   makes an original contribution to knowledge with the development of this
   framework as a systematic way to map existing (and new) solutions that
   can potentially tackle the plastic packaging waste and pollution
   problem.},

Title = {Implementing circular economy and sustainability policies in Rwanda:
   Experiences of Rwandan manufacturers with the plastic ban policy},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {4},
Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {Despite the rise of plastic waste regulation and rising trends in the
   adoption of circular economy (CE) policies globally, investigations of
   their impact on businesses remain limited. Research on adoption of CE
   policies in Africa is particularly limited despite African countries
   leading the uptake of plastic ban laws and CE-related policies. This
   paper examines how the 10-R principles of CE feature in Rwanda's
   sustainability policies, and provides the experiences of Rwandan
   manufacturers following the implementation of the plastic ban. A
   qualitative review of key environmental sustainability policies in
   Rwanda shows alignment to different levels of 10-R principles of the
   circular economy. Meanwhile, field interviews with leading manufacturers
   comprising producers and users of single-use plastics in Rwanda indicate
   that businesses have faced internal and external challenges complying
   with the plastic ban and CE-related policies. These challenges range
   from limited capital to acquire new industrial technology, lack of
   expertise to develop circular business models, lack of alternative
   packaging to plastics, to loss in market competition since Rwanda's
   competitors in the international market still use cheap plastic
   packaging. Consequently, our findings indicate that insufficient
   government support such as lack of finance and capacity development to
   develop new business models, ambiguous regulatory framework, and
   inadequate stakeholder consultations impedes business uptake of CE and
   other sustainability policies. In addition to providing policy and
   managerial implications, we conclude by underscoring the importance of
   continued collaboration between government in terms of regulation,
   innovation from businesses, and consumer actions, in tackling
   environmental challenges caused by plastic waste and implementation of
   CE and other green policies.},

Abstract = {The rapid economic and industrial growth experienced in the Asian region
   has significantly increased waste production, particularly single-use
   plastic. This surge in waste poses a significant challenge for these
   countries' municipal solid waste management systems. Consequently, there
   is a pressing need for progressive and effective solutions to address
   the plastic waste issue. One promising initiative involves utilizing
   used plastic to produce components for asphalt pavement. The concept of
   plastic road technology has gained traction in Asia, with 32 countries
   displaying varying levels of interest, ranging from small-scale
   laboratory experiments to large-scale construction projects. However, as
   a relatively new technology, plastic road implementation requires
   continuous and comprehensive environmental and health risk assessments
   to ascertain its viability as a reliable green technology. This review
   paper presents the current findings and potential implementation of
   plastic-modified asphalt in Asian countries, with particular attention
   given to its environmental and human health impacts. While plastic
   asphalt roads hold promise in waste reduction, improved asphalt
   properties, and cost savings, it is imperative to thoroughly consider
   the environmental and health impacts, quality control measures,
   recycling limitations, and long-term performance of this road
   construction material. Further research and evaluation are needed to
   fully understand the viability and sustainability of plastic asphalt
   roads. This will enable a comprehensive assessment of its potential
   benefits and drawbacks, aiding in developing robust guidelines and
   standards for its implementation. By addressing these considerations, it
   will be possible to optimize the utilization of plastic waste in road
   construction and contribute to a greener and more sustainable future.},

Abstract = {Microplastics pose a severe threat to ecosystems, human health, and
   aquatic life, and are a major global contributor to water contamination.
   Despite this, the impact of microplastics in estuaries, where freshwater
   meets saltwater, has received insufficient attention. This study
   investigates the characteristics, distribution, risks, and sources of
   microplastics in the Muttukadu backwater estuary, a vital ecosystem in
   Tamil Nadu, India. The results show that the average abundance of
   microplastics in water (2.75 f 1.80 items/m3) and sediments (3.15 f 1.81
   items/kg) was higher during the wet season (November) than the dry
   season (March) (1.95 f 1.63 items/ m3 in water and 2.55 f 2.25 items/kg
   in sediments). The dominant forms of microplastics found were fragments
   (60 \%) and fibers (30 \%), primarily blue (27 \%), black (25 \%), and
   red (20 \%) in color, and measuring 500-1000 mu m in size (50 \%). FTIR
   analysis identified five polymers, with Polyamide being the most
   abundant, followed by Polypropylene, Polyethylene, Polystyrene, and
   Low-Density Polyethylene. Source apportionment studies, combining
   morphological identification and chemical composition of microplastics,
   revealed single-use plastics, boating, and fishing practices as major
   contributors to microplastic contamination. An ecological risk index,
   assessing the potential harm of microplastics to the environment,
   indicated a medium to high-risk category for the estuarine environment.
   This study provides valuable insights and actionable recommendations for
   stakeholders to establish effective mitigation measures, including waste
   reduction policies, public awareness campaigns, and regular monitoring
   and cleanup efforts, ultimately reducing microplastic pollution and
   protecting the estuarine environment.},

   aspects, emphasizing the need to prioritize environmental impact over
   purely economic considerations. While it is recognized that financial
   challenges have constrained many past attempts at scaling pyrolysis
   systems, this paper argues that a shift in focus toward sustainability
   criteria is essential for the technology's long-term viability.
   Prioritizing environmental outcomes is critical given the pressing
   issues like plastic pollution, which presents significant threats to
   ecosystems and human health. A comprehensive assessment of environmental
   impacts is vital for technologies intended for largescale deployment,
   ensuring that they align with global sustainability goals. This
   perspective is especially pertinent in light of the current United
   Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) global plastic pollution treaty
   negotiations, where there is a contentious debate over the true
   circularity of chemical recycling. Environmentalists and several nations
   advocate for significant reductions in plastic production and bans on
   single-use plastics. At the same time, oil-producing countries and
   petrochemical companies push for circularity in the plastic economy. The
   paper explores the promise and limitations of pyrolysis technology for
   valorizing plastic wastes, comparing its efficacy with other waste
   management methods. Biomass pyrolysis is discussed due to its
   significant synergies with plastic pyrolysis and its potential for
   carbon sequestration through biochar. However, the discussion on biomass
   pyrolysis is limited in scope, with the paper's primary focus on waste
   plastic pyrolysis. The paper discusses the challenges and opportunities
   in utilizing pyrolysis for waste plastics, which are considered along
   with regulatory and geopolitical aspects. Environmental impacts,
   including life cycle analysis and planetary boundary considerations, are
   examined to understand why pyrolysis has yet to achieve widespread
   adoption. A case study on Plastic Energy, SABIC, and Unilever highlights
   current industry status, technological advancements, and information
   gaps. Finally, a comprehensive framework is proposed to achieve net-zero
   emissions, improve air quality, and ensure absolute environmental
   sustainability in plastic recycling. Recommendations are provided for
   the plastic industry and research institutions to support the transition
   towards sustainable waste management practices.},

Abstract = {BackgroundOperative microscopes are traditionally draped in single-use
   plastic to prevent infection theoretically. The necessity of this
   routine in breast free flap surgery is unclear. Alternatively, sterile
   wrapping of microscope handles would reduce operating room waste and
   provide a more cost-effective and environmentally sustainable approach
   to sterility. This study aimed to determine whether the draping
   technique used during abdominally based free flaps (Ab-FF) influenced
   the rate of surgical site infections.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective
   review of Ab-FF performed consecutively between March 2017 and August
   2022. Patient demographics, comorbidities, perioperative data, and
   postoperative complications were collected. The primary outcomes
   included postoperative surgical site infections and environmental
   impact.ResultsOf the 281 identified breasts reconstructed with Ab-FF,
   operating microscopes were sterilely covered with microscope drapes (n =
   215) or handle covers (n = 66) composed of polyethylene-based plastic.
   Overall, postoperative infections occurred in 9.3\% of cases (n = 26) in
   either the recipient breast (n = 11, 3.9\%) or abdominal donor site (n =
   15, 5.3\%), primarily due to S. aureus and Streptococcus species. The
   handle (n = 6, 9.1\%) and drape (n = 20, 9.3\%) cohorts had similar
   infection rates with no sequelae of operative complications. In
   multivariate analysis, radiation was the only independent predictor of
   postoperative infection, while bilateral reconstructions were
   independently protective. Replacing a microscope drape with a handle
   reduces carbon emissions by 1276 grams of CO2 and direct costs by \$7.84
   per item.ConclusionsThe principles of ``Lean and Green{''} surgery
   prioritize reducing operating room generated waste to achieve financial
   and environmental sustainability. This cohort study of 281 breast free
   flaps demonstrates that switching from whole microscope draping to
   handle wrapping was not associated with an increased rate or odds of
   infection. Adopting a microscope handle wrapping protocol decreased the
   carbon footprint and operative costs. The results of this study offer
   evidence to support adoption and further exploration of pragmatic,
   cost-effective, and sustainable approaches to microsurgical breast
   reconstruction.},

Abstract = {Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), including microplastics, have
   been the focus of many studies due to their environmental impact,
   affecting biota and human health. The diverse land uses and occupation
   of watersheds are important parameters driving the occurrence of these
   contaminants. CECs such as pesticides, drugs, hormones, and
   industrial-origin substances were analyzed in urban/industrial (Atibaia)
   and agricultural (Preto/Turvo) watersheds located in S \& atilde;o Paulo
   state, Brazil. A total of 24 CECs were investigated, and, as a result,
   only 5 (caffeine, carbendazim, atrazine, ametrine and 2-hydroxytrazine)
   were responsible for 81.73 \% of the statistical difference between
   watersheds contamination profile. The Atibaia watershed presented
   considerable concentrations of caffeine (ranging from 75 to 2025 ng
   L-1), while carbendazim (44 to 1144 ng L-1) and atrazine (3 to 266 ng
   L-1) presented highest levels in Preto/Turvo watershed. In all sampling
   points, the cumulative potential aquatic life risk assessed by the
   NORMAN database indicates some level of environmental concern associated
   to pesticides and caffeine (risk quotient >1). Microplastics had been
   analyzed in both watersheds, being the white/transparent fragments in
   size between 100 and 250 mu m the most detected in this study. The
   estimated abundance in the Atibaia watershed ranged from 349 to 2898
   items m(-3) presenting some influence of pluviosity, while in Rio
   Preto/Turvo ranged from 169 to 6370 items m(-3), being more abundant in
   the dam area without a clear influence of pluviosity. In both basins,
   polyethylene and polypropylene were the most detected polymers, probably
   due to the intense use of single-use plastics in urban areas. Possibly,
   due to the distinct physic-chemical properties of microplastics and
   organic CECs, no correlations were observed between their occurrence,
   which makes us conclude that they have different transport mechanism,
   behavior, and fate in the environment.},

   highly efficient capture and precise detection of nanoplastics},

Abstract = {Nanoplastics, which are small plastic particles resulting from the
   decomposition of plastic waste, can accumulate and adsorb toxic
   chemicals in aquatic environments, leading to detrimental effects on the
   environment and human health. Consequently, there is an urgent demand
   for the development of an efficient method to accurately quantify and
   effectively remove nanoplastics. Here, we prepared a novel
   ``cage-like{''} microrobot for effective dynamic capture and highly
   sensitive surface-enhanced Raman scattering detection of nanoplastics in
   situ. The microrobot utilizes water as fuel under visible light and
   achieves efficient capture of nanoplastics within 2 min on the basis of
   the stacking structure between layers and electrostatic action. The
   microrobot could be recovered by an external magnetic field, and the
   SERS activity was greatly enhanced through the coupling of multilayer
   hot spots, with a detection limit of 1.27 mu g/mL. We built a simple
   device to demonstrate the feasibility of the microrobot strategy of
   capturing plastic in real wastewater and further extended this
   technology to single-use plastic cups in everyday life. Moreover, many
   different types of plastic spectra can also be quickly distinguished
   when combined with machine learning. This work provides new ideas for
   improving the dynamic capture and effective monitoring of nanoplastics.},

Abstract = {In a world where plastics have become an integral part of daily life,
   the ubiquitous presence of microplastics (MPs) is hardly surprising.
   However, the emergence of MPs in one of humanity's most vital
   resources-groundwater-is concerning. This review explores the widespread
   reports of MPs in drinking water, examining their origins and the
   potential effects of their associated pollutants on human health. The
   exploration was facilitated through an exhaustive analysis of research
   contributions across the topic. Instances of MPs infiltrating drinking
   water have been documented across 42 countries, including Australia,
   Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Iceland, Nepal, Nigeria, the
   United Kingdom, and the United States. The identification of the sources
   of these MPs is crucial, and this review clarifies several significant
   contributors. The sources encompass atmospheric contamination, the
   packaging and distribution processes associated with bottled water,
   effluents generated from laundry activities, fertilizers, and the
   domestic/industrial wastewater streams. Furthermore, the review
   emphasizes the role of MP particles as carriers, facilitating the
   transportation of heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants, and
   emergent contaminants into drinking water. While scientific evidence to
   definitively establish the impacts of MPs on human health remains an
   evolving field, it is paramount to recognize that their associated
   pollutants have tangible effects that warrant attention. Among the
   potential effects highlighted are anemia, brain cancer, hypertension,
   intestinal bleeding, methemoglobinemia, and liver cancer. Addressing the
   pressing need for actionable measures, this review offers practical
   strategies to counter the presence of existing MPs in drinking water and
   mitigate their further proliferation. The insights and recommendations
   presented herein are anticipated to provide valuable contributions
   toward the resolution of the menace posed by MP contamination in
   drinking water, as well as the broader challenge of plastic pollution at
   large.},

Title = {Biodegradable UV-Protective Composite Film from Cellulosic Waste:
   Utilisation of Cotton Gin Motes as Biocomponent},
Journal = {POLYMERS},

Abstract = {With an increase in environmental pollution and microplastic problems,
   it is more urgent now to replace non-biodegradable films with
   biodegradable films that are low-cost and from renewable resources.
   Cotton gin motes (GM), a type of cellulosic waste that is generated from
   cotton ginning, is an excellent candidate for fabricating biodegradable
   films due to its properties and abundance. In this study, GM was first
   mechanically milled into a fine powder, followed by compounding with
   polycaprolactone (PCL) and extruded to produce composite pellets which
   were then compress-moulded into composite films. This environmentally
   friendly process used physical processing and all the materials were
   consumed in the process without generating any waste residue. To improve
   the compatibility and mixing properties between GM and PCL, the use of a
   plasticiser (polyethylene glycol) was considered. A high content of GM
   powder (up to 50\%) was successfully compounded with the polymer. The
   SEM images of the composite films showed smooth surface morphology and
   well-distributed GM powder in the PCL matrix. The added advantage of
   compounding GM with the polymer matrix was that the composite film
   developed UV-shielding properties due to the presence of lignin in the
   GM powder. This property will be critical for films used in
   UV-resistance applications. Furthermore, the composite even with high GM
   content (50\%), showed good mechanical properties, with 9.5 MPa yield
   strength and 442\% elongation, which was only a 50\% decrease in
   elongation when compared with clear PCL film. The soil biodegradation of
   GM composite films under controlled temperature (20 degrees C) and
   humidity (50\%) for 1 month showed around 41\% weight loss. Overall,
   this study demonstrates the potential of GM to be used as a
   biodegradable and UV-protective composite film for a wide array of
   applications, such as packaging and UV-protective coverings.},

Title = {Reducing the carbon footprint for a 30-bed haemodialysis unit by
   changing the delivery of acid concentrate supplied by individual 5 L
   containers to a central delivery system},

Abstract = {Background Haemodialysis treatments generate greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions mainly as a result of the equipment, consumables and
   pharmaceuticals required. An internal audit demonstrated a 33\% wastage
   of acid concentrate when using individual 5.0 L containers at a 1:44
   dilution ratio. We therefore investigated whether changing the delivery
   system for acid concentrate would reduce wastage and any associated
   greenhouse gas emissions. Methods We calculated the difference for a
   30-bed dialysis unit between receiving acid concentrate in single-use
   5.0 L plastic containers versus bulk delivery for a central acid
   delivery system connected to the dialysis machines. Estimates of carbon
   dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions were made using the United Kingdom
   government database and other sources. Results A 30-station dialysis
   unit functioning at maximum capacity (3 shifts and 6 days/week),
   switching to bulk delivery and central acid delivery could realise an
   approximate total reduction of 33,841 kgCO2e/year; in reduced product
   wastage, saving 6192 kgCO2e, 5205 kgCO2e from fewer deliveries, and
   22,444 kgCO2e saving from a reduction in packaging and waste generated,
   which equates approximately to a one tonne reduction in CO2e emissions
   per dialysis station/year. Conclusions Switching from delivering acid
   concentrate in individual 5.0 L containers to a central acid delivery
   system can result in substantial reductions in CO2e emissions within a
   dialysis clinic. The emission savings from reducing the single-use
   plastic packaging greatly outweigh any gains from eliminating wastage of
   acid concentrate. Dialysis companies and clinicians should consider
   reviewing the design of current and future dialysis facilities and
   policies to determine whether reductions in CO2e emissions can be made.},

Abstract = {Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is a prevalent single-use plastic,
   posing a significant threat to the environment and human health due to
   its nondegradable properties. To confront this pressing issue, there is
   an urgent need for a method of PET degradation that is not only
   efficient but also cost-effective. Recognizing the intricate
   interactions of parameters, we propose an innovative approach that
   integrates two-step machine learning (ML) techniques to achieve our
   objective while minimizing experimental costs. A dataset comprising 120
   distinct PET degradation conditions was created using high-throughput
   experimentation (HTE). Initially, eight ML algorithms were employed to
   train and predict performance, with the decision tree model yielding the
   most favorable outcomes. Subsequently, the trained ML model was expanded
   to encompass an extensive array of hypothetical reaction conditions,
   facilitating the identification of degradation formulations that exhibit
   exceptional performance. Additionally, through the integration of
   feature importance analysis, we systematically reconstruct a relevant
   chemical space. Following regression training and prediction, we
   identified reaction conditions with significantly higher degradation
   rates at ambient temperature. The utilization of these conditions not
   only enhances the efficacy of research and development, leading to
   reduced experimental costs, but also provides valuable insights for
   future investigations into PET degradation. In contrast to conventional,
   resource-intensive trial-and-error approaches, our established platform
   facilitates the assessment of PET degradation rates across diverse
   reaction conditions, enabling a preliminary screening for process
   optimization. Consequently, this approach contributes to the mitigation
   of solid waste pollution and the advancement of sustainable economic
   development.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the need for contactless and sustainable systems has
   become increasingly relevant. The traditional water dispensers, which
   require contact with the dispenser and often involve single-use plastic
   cups or bottles, are not only unhygienic but also contribute to
   environmental pollution. This paper presents a touchless water dispenser
   system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to control the dispensing
   of water or any liquid beverage. The system is designed to fill a
   container under the nozzle, dispense water when the container is aligned
   with the flow, and stop dispensing when the container is full, all
   without requiring any physical contact. This approach ensures compliance
   with hygiene regulations and promotes environmental sustainability by
   eliminating the need for plastic bottles or cups, making it a
   ``plastic-free{''} and ``zero waste{''} system. The prototype is based
   on a computer vision approach that employs an RGB camera and a Raspberry
   Pi board, which allows for real-time image processing and machine
   learning operations. The system uses image processing techniques to
   detect the presence of a container under the nozzle and then utilizes AI
   algorithms to control the flow of liquid. The system is trained using
   machine learning models and optimized to ensure accuracy and efficiency.
   We discuss the development and implementation of the touchless water
   dispenser system, including the hardware and software components used,
   the algorithms employed, and the testing and evaluation of the system.
   The results of our experiments show that the touchless water dispenser
   system is highly accurate and efficient, and it offers a safe and
   sustainable alternative to traditional water dispensers. The system has
   the potential to be used in a variety of settings, including public
   spaces, hospitals, schools, and offices, where hygiene and
   sustainability are of utmost importance.},

Title = {Life cycle assessment of reusable plastic food packaging},

Abstract = {The present study focuses on the cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment
   (LCA) of a reusable takeaway food container. The system boundary
   includes the production, transport, use, and end of life (EoL) stages of
   container, considering recycling and incineration, including all the
   inputs (material and energy) and outputs (emissions). Scenarios (10, 30,
   and 100 uses of a reusable container with EoL) were proposed and
   compared with a single-use container. The primary data was collected
   from industry and secondary data was taken from the literature and the
   Ecoienven 3.9.1 database. The functional unit (FU) was ``one use of a
   container ``, and the ReCiPe 2016 Midpoint (H) method was used. The
   results showed that with a centralised collection and washing system,
   the global warming potential (GWP) for a single-use container (0.020 kg
   CO 2 eq./FU) per FU had higher GWP than 10 uses (0.015 kg CO 2 eq./FU),
   30 uses and 100 uses (0.007 kg CO 2 eq./FU) of the reusable container
   (EoL recycling). The GWP of a single-use container is 1.3 times higher
   than 10 uses of the container which results in a minimum six uses of the
   reusable container, providing a benefit over single-use container (EoL
   recycling). In EoL incineration, 10 uses scenario led to a decrease in
   the GWP of 46\%, while 100 uses resulted in a significant reduction in
   the GWP of 83\% compared to single-use per FU. It was found that the
   efficiency of the return system for empty containers significantly
   influenced the results. This study also quantified potential plastic
   waste for various scenarios.},

Title = {Modeling the Environmental and Financial Impact of Multi-dose vs.
   Single-dose Iodinated Contrast Media Packaging and Delivery Systems},
Journal = {ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {30},

Pages = {1017-1023},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: Iodinated contrast media (ICM) is used in
   computed tomography (CT) imaging to better visualize pathophysiol-ogy.
   ICM is commonly sold in ``single-dose{''} bottles that require any
   unused volume to be discarded. Multi-dose bottles have been devel-oped
   as an alternative packaging method. The objective of this study was to
   compare ICM waste, plastic waste, and the associated financial costs for
   both the single-dose and multi-dose ICM delivery systems. Methods:
   Institutional data was used to estimate the average ICM administered per
   CT scan, average ICM wasted per CT scan, and the total ICM volume wasted
   annually. Waste estimates for the multi-dose bottles were generated by
   applying the average ICM administered per CT scan to the larger,
   multi-dose bottle volumes. Single-dose bottles, multi-dose bottles and
   injection syringes were weighed and used to calculate plastic waste
   generated by both packaging methods. Financial analysis was performed to
   compare the cost of supplies for single-dose and multi-dose ICM delivery
   systems. Results: We found that 100 mL single-dose ICM bottles waste an
   average of 19.7 mL per CT scan, representing over 964 L of ICM wasted
   per year. The multi-dose ICM delivery system was projected to decrease
   pharmaceutical waste by at least 73\% and reduce plastic waste by
   approximately 93\%. We also estimate \$494,000 in annual savings using
   the multi-dose ICM delivery method at our institution. Conclusion:
   Multi-dose ICM packaging can help conserve ICM, an important
   pharmaceutical that was only recently severely affected supply chain
   disruptions. The multi-dose delivery system can also reduce plastic
   waste and generate substantial financial savings to off-set capital
   investment.},

Title = {Journey to the deep: plastic pollution in the hadal of deep-sea
   trenches.{*}},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {333},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {The global increase of plastic production, linked with an overall
   plastic misuse and waste mismanagement, leads to an inevitable increase
   of plastic debris that ends up in our oceans. One of the major sinks of
   this pollution is the deep-sea floor, which is hypothesized to
   accumulate in its deepest points, the hadal trenches. Little is known
   about the magnitude of pollution in these trenches, given the remoteness
   of these environments, numerous factors influencing the input and
   sinking behavior of plastic debris from shallower environments. This
   study represents to the best of our knowledge the largest survey of
   (macro)plastic debris sampled at hadal depths, down to 9600 m.
   Industrial packaging and material assignable to fishing activities were
   the most common debris items in the Kuril Kamchatka trench, most likely
   deriving from long-distance transport by the Kuroshio extension current
   (KE) or from regional marine traffic and fishing activities. The
   chemical analysis by (Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier transform
   infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy revealed that the main polymers
   detected were polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and nylon. Plastic
   waste is reaching the depths of the trench, although some of the items
   were only partially broken down. This finding suggests that complete
   breakdown into secondary microplastics (MP) may not always occur at the
   sea surface or though the water column. Due to increased brittleness,
   plastic debris may break apart upon reaching the hadal trench floor
   where plastic degrading factors were thought to be, coming off. The
   KKT's remote location and high sedimentation rates make it a potential
   site for high levels of plastic pollution, potentially making it one of
   the world's most heavily contaminated marine areas and an oceanic
   plastic deposition zone.},

Title = {Production of thermostable recombinant cutinase using mixed food waste:
   A sustainable approach toward environmental remediation},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {496},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Recently, there has been a significant surge in the utilization of
   single-use plastics. Cost-effective degradation of plastics is
   imperative to reduce the ecological burden. This study explores the
   overproduction and characterization of a PET (Polyethylene
   terephthalate) a degrading enzyme, cutinase, in the E. coli BL21 (DE3)
   expression system. Furthermore, this research delves into the
   utilization of mixed food waste (MFW) as a sustainable substrate for the
   production of Cutinase, replacing commercial glucose. The newly isolated
   strain, Aspergillus terreus, showed the highest glucoamylase activity of
   76.10 +/- 3.10 U/g. The enzymatic hydrolysis of mixed food waste
   resulted in 50 +/- 0.4 g/L of glucose, used as feedstock for cutinase
   production. The crude enzyme activity was evaluated to be 11.64 U/mg,
   and a further 14.11-fold purification was achieved through IMAC. The
   purified recombinant enzyme showed its maximum activity at 70degree
   celsius and pH 7. The metal ion Na+ increased the enzyme activity by 26
   \% while Zn+2 significantly inhibited the same (47 \% inhibition); other
   ions had little or no effect. Taguchi's optimization of five variables
   showed that the concentration of food waste hydrolysate has the maximum
   impact on enzyme production. The treatment of commercially available PET
   bottles using the purified enzyme showed characterizable surface
   degradation effects. This is the first time food waste hydrolysate was
   used as a sole carbon source to produce recombinant cutinase. This
   approach can potentially pave the way for sustainable biorefinery and
   waste management.},

Title = {Sustainable building solutions: A comprehensive study on PCPET
   waste-induced bricks},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {456},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {An exponential increase in plastic production and a substantial rise in
   plastic waste have forced scholars to seek a sustainable and
   groundbreaking solution that recycles/reuses plastic waste to minimize
   its adverse environmental impacts upon disposal. Having been used by
   various sectors, production of construction material from plastic waste
   has received more interest. Numerous studies have proven that shredded
   polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles constitute a valuable
   construction material where plastic waste management/ recycling
   procedures are not effective. The goal of this study lies in factors
   such as strengthening construction material, reducing carbon emissions
   in atmosphere and minimizing overall costs. Manufacturing plastic M-sand
   bricks, and integrating post-consumer PET (PCPET) from single-use
   plastic water bottles into M-Sand is the main focus of our research.
   This work used two types of PCPET wastes (washed and unwashed) with
   different mix proportions of plastic and M-sand, such as 1:1, 1:2 and
   2:1 for brick production. The bricks manufactured are tested for
   durability through compression, water absorption, efflorescence, and
   dimensional stability, and subsequently, Energy Dispersive X-ray
   Analysis (EDX) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for morphological
   assessment. By the conducted experiential results, it is evident that
   the design mixes M3 and M8 guarantee appreciable strength that is 2-1.5
   times of other mix designs. The M3 design mix with one part washed PCPET
   and two parts M-sand has exhibited superior performance, with a
   compressive strength of 40.29 N/mm2, minimal water absorption, and
   observed homogeneity in SEM. In addition, post-demolition sustainability
   is addressed by integrating recycled brick aggregate with M-sand,
   showing optimal results for design mix M8, including a compressive
   strength of 40.54 N/mm2, favorable water absorption, and positive SEM
   findings. EDX confirmed zero carbon elements in the produced bricks.
   These findings prove the strength of our research on the sustainable
   recycling of waste thermoplastics within the circular economy,
   presenting a promising solution to environmental and economic
   challenges.},

Abstract = {Little were certain about how wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)
   affected the Japanese riverine microplastic contamination. This study
   explored the influences of WWTPs on microplastic pollution, assessed
   ecological risks, and looked at the sources-to-sinks phenomenon
   (WWTPs-to-rivers-to-marine) in riverine settings in Japan's Yamaguchi
   prefecture. Fifty surface water samples from the five selected rivers
   (Koya, Saba, Shimaji, and Fushino, Nishiki) and 11 effluent samples from
   WWTPs in the rivers' catchment were examined. Microplastics were
   analyzed using filtration, wet-peroxidation, density-separation, and
   attenuated reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
   techniques. Results suggested that the less populated and rural river
   (Nishiki) was less contaminated compared to the WWTPs and urban areas
   affected rivers (Koya, Saba, Shimaji, and Fushino). The WWTPs increased
   microplastic abundance twofold in the downstream regions compared to
   upstream stations. Microplastic characterization showed that the smaller
   microplastics < 500 \& mu;m, fiber-shaped, transparent, blue, and green
   color particles were major. Polymer identification demonstrated that the
   polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate were
   prevalent both for the rivers and WWTP effluents. There was a
   significant emission of microplastics from WWTPs to rivers (4.671
   billion pieces per day; 71.8 kg per day) and rivers to Seto Inland Sea
   (0.13/billion pieces per day/km(2); 7.1 kg per day). The per capita MP
   emissions to the rivers via WWTPs ranged from 0.02 to 6.49 g per day,
   which was approximately 2\% of per capita single-use plastic wastes in
   Japan. An assessment of ecological risks showed that the WWTPs posed
   high ecological risks to rivers, and built up the pollution hotspots to
   their downstream areas by releasing higher number of microplastics and
   highly toxic polymers. Overall, the WWTPs influenced the rivers through
   both abundances and characteristics (shapes-size-color-polymers),
   increased the complexity of microplastic compositions as well as
   elevated ecological risks in the rivers. This study contributed to
   bridging the knowledge gaps about microplastic sources-to-sinks,
   ecological risks, and pollution management in Japan and beyond.},

Title = {Consumer perceptions and behaviors toward take-out food plastic
   packaging reduction: A case study of college students in China},
Journal = {CIRCULAR ECONOMY},

Abstract = {With the prevalence of online take-out food, the increasingly generated
   single-use plastic packaging waste has aroused public concern in the
   context of combating plastic pollution globally. The majority of present
   studies have focused on product design and policy design to influence
   the corporate behaviors in packaging waste management. Few attentions
   have been concentrated on consumer perceptions, a neglected vital factor
   in commercial practices, which determines whether the proposed measures
   can be effectively applied. This study takes college students, the main
   consumer group of take-out who are most likely to receive new
   environmental protection concepts, as a case study and employs the
   contingent valuation method to investigate their perceptions and
   behaviors toward emerging plastic packaging reduction approaches and
   taxation mechanisms. It was found that packaging circulation was
   preferred mostly with a proportion of 73.20\% of the respondents, while
   taxation mechanism was more favored by those who have higher daily
   expenditure on meals. Gender, living costs and ordering frequency could
   significantly influence the acceptance levels. Therefore, a circulation
   mechanism using cabinet near takeout food hot spots and third-party
   cleaning services could target students and officers as pioneers.
   Regarding the taxation approach, it was suggested that the payment that
   most of the respondents could accept is 1.5 CNY. This study serves as a
   reference for the reduction of plastic waste from take-out packaging on
   campus, and provides a possible model that could reduce the
   environmental impacts of take-out food packaging through both taxation
   and circulation measures. The findings are expected to bring primary
   insights for take-out food plastic packaging reduction in China. For
   future studies, the methodology of this study was also well-prepared to
   investigate a larger scale of consumers and develop a more universal
   policy. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of

Title = {Should intermittent pneumatic compression devices be standard therapy
   for the prevention of venous thromboembolic events in major surgery?
   Protocol for a randomised clinical trial (IMPOSTERS)},

Abstract = {Introduction Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a recognised postsurgical
   risk. Current prevention methods involve low molecular weight heparin
   (LMWH), graduated compression stockings (GCS), and intermittent
   pneumatic compression devices (IPCDs). Australian guidelines, commonly
   adopted by surgeons, recommend LMWH with GCS and/or IPCDs. IPCDs pose
   clinical risks, increase care burden, are poorly tolerated, and are
   costly single-use plastic items. Utilising only LMWH and GCS, without
   IPCDs, could be more practical, patient-friendly, and cost-effective,
   with added environmental benefits.Methods This is a multicentre,
   prospective, two-arm randomised controlled non-inferiority trial at five
   New South Wales (NSW) hospitals, in Australia. We propose to randomise
   4130 participants in a 1:1 ratio between arm A: LMWH+GCS+IPCDs (n=2065)
   or arm B: LMWH+GCS (n=2065). The primary outcome of interest is
   symptomatic VTE (deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism) identified at
   the day 30 phone follow-up (FU), confirmed by ultrasound or imaging.
   Radiologists interpreting the lower-extremity ultrasonography will be
   blinded to intervention allocation. Secondary outcomes are quality of
   life at baseline, days 30 and 90 FU using the 5-level European Quality
   of Life Score, compliance and adverse events with IPCDs, GCS, and LMWH,
   as well as healthcare costs (from the perspective of the patient and the
   hospital), and all-cause mortality. The trial has 90\% power to detect a
   2\% non-inferiority margin to detect a reduction rate of VTE from 4\% to
   2\%.Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the Hunter
   New England Human Research Ethics Committee (2022/ETH02276) protocol
   V.10, 13 July 2023. Study findings will be presented at local and
   national conferences and in scientific research journals.Trial

Abstract = {This study presents a comprehensive analysis of plastic waste
   accumulation in both terrestrial and aquatic environments in Can Tho
   city, Vietnam, a nation with high per capita plastic consumption and
   significant plastic waste discharge. Focusing on urban residential
   areas, riverside communities, suburbs, and rural regions, the research
   investigates the extent and impact of plastic waste in these diverse
   settings. Additionally, the study examines the accumulation of plastics
   at barriers, under bridges, and in the Hau River, identifying the
   predominance of single-use plastics and their environmental
   implications. The key findings indicate that the plastic waste leakage
   at land-based-source emission sites is substantial, with waste
   persisting for extended periods without effective clean-up. The study
   reveals a significant accumulation of plastics at barriers and bridge
   bases in aquatic environments, including along the river. The pollution
   level was observed to be more influenced by the quantity of waste rather
   than its mass per unit area, emphasizing the need for targeted waste
   reduction strategies. The study also identifies seven types of plastic,
   each associated with different sources of accumulation or settlement.
   This variety presents both challenges and opportunities for waste
   management and recycling. Significantly, the research underscores the
   potential of repurposing plastic waste into recycled products, aligning
   with the circular economy model. This approach not only extends the
   lifecycle of plastic products but also contributes to reducing plastic
   waste generation and minimizing the environmental impact. Overall, the
   findings highlight the urgent need for improved waste management
   practices in Vietnam, particularly in urban and riverside areas, and
   advocate for innovative recycling solutions to mitigate the
   environmental challenges posed by plastic pollution.},

Title = {Microplastics in Ecuador: A review of environmental and health-risk
   assessment challenges},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Pollution from plastic debris and microplastics (MPs) is a worldwide
   issue. Classified as emerging contaminants, MPs have become widespread
   and have been found not only in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems but
   also within the food chain, which affects both the environment and human
   health. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the consumption of single-use
   plastics has drastically increased, intensifying mismanaged plastic
   waste in countries such as Ecuador. Therefore, the aim of this review is
   to 1) summarize the state of MP-related knowledge, focusing on studies
   conducted with environmental matrices, biota, and food, and 2) analyze
   the efforts by different national authorities and entities in Ecuador to
   control MP contamination. Results showed a limited number of studies
   have been done in Ecuador, which have mainly focused on the surface
   water of coastal areas, followed by studies on sediment and food. MPs
   were identified in all samples, indicating the lack of wastewater
   management policies, deficient management of solid wastes, and the
   contribution of anthropogenic activities such as artisanal fishing and
   aquaculture to water ecosystem pollution, which affects food webs.
   Moreover, studies have shown that food contamination can occur through
   atmospheric deposition of MPs; however, ingredients and inputs from food
   production, processing, and packaging, as well as food containers,
   contribute to MP occurrence in food. Further research is needed to
   develop more sensitive, precise, and reliable detection methods and
   assess MPs' impact on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, biota, and
   human health. In Ecuador specifically, implementing wastewater treatment
   plants in major cities, continuously monitoring MP coastal
   contamination, and establishing environmental and food safety
   regulations are crucial. Additionally, national authorities need to
   develop programs to raise public awareness of plastic use and its
   environmental effects, as well as MP exposure's effects on human health.},

Abstract = {The archaeology of plastic is many things at once: an environmental
   crisis, a growing impact on existing maritime and terrestrial
   archaeological resources, an advancement in material culture, and the
   foundation of future archaeological deposits. It is the shape of things
   as they are now and the shape of things to come. This article explores
   the intersection between the environmental crisis of unfettered plastic
   production and archaeology, with an eye toward understanding archaeology
   as a platform for activism and public outreach during the continuing
   climate crisis. It offers new paths forward for addressing plastic
   pollution in the discipline of archaeology as well as actions concerned
   citizens can take individually.
   La arqueologia de los plasticos es muchas cosas a la vez: una crisis
   ambiental, un impacto creciente sobre los recursos arqueologicos
   maritimos y terrestres existentes, un avance en la cultura material y la
   fundacion de futuros yacimientos arqueologicos. Es la forma de las cosas
   como son ahora y la forma de las cosas por venir. En este articulo se
   explora la interseccion entre la crisis ambiental por la produccion de
   plasticos sin restricciones y la arqueologia, con miras a comprender la
   arqueologia como una plataforma para el activismo y la divulgacion
   publica durante la continua crisis climatica. Se ofrecen nuevos caminos
   para abordar la contaminacion por plasticos en la disciplina de la
   arqueologia, asi como acciones que los ciudadanos preocupados pueden
   tomar individualmente.
   L'archeologie du plastique recouvre simultanement plusieurs elements :
   une crise environnementale, un impact croissant sur les ressources
   archeologiques maritimes et terrestres, une avancee de la culture
   materielle et la fondation de vestiges archeologiques futurs. Il s'agit
   de la situation telle qu'elle est de nos jours et de celle a venir. Cet
   article est une etude de l'intersection entre la crise environnementale
   de la production sans entraves du plastique et l'archeologie, dans
   l'objectif d'apprehender l'archeologie en tant que plateforme pour un
   activisme et une sensibilisation du public durant la crise climatique en
   cours. Il propose des avancees nouvelles pour le traitement de la
   pollution par le plastique dans la discipline de l'archeologie ainsi que
   des actions que les citoyens impliques peuvent engager individuellement.},

Title = {Adsorption of trace metals onto different plastics during long-term
   exposure in an estuarine environment: Influence of time, stratified
   water column, and specific surface area},
Journal = {MARINE CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {265},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The pervasive increase of plastics in marine systems and subsequent
   trace metals (TM) adsorption represents a critical environmental
   challenge. This long-term study is first to investigate how duration of
   exposure and stratified water column impact TM adsorption on various
   plastics in an estuary. We exposed polypropylene (PP), polyethylene
   (PE), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), and fluorinated ethylene
   propylene (FEP) to estuarine conditions, categorizing them into three
   distinct groups to capture diverse human activities: pre-production
   pellets (Pellets), single-use plastics (SUP) and laboratory plastics
   (Lab). Plastic and water samples were analyzed before deployment and 1,
   4, 7 and 16 months after deployment at three depths in the stratified
   Krka River estuary (Croatia). We measured TM concentrations, pH and
   salinity in the water column, and adsorbed TM amounts on plastics.
   Additionally, we examined plastic sample surfaces by Raman spectroscopy
   and scanning electron microscopy. TM speciation was modeled from water
   column data to better explain adsorption processes. Statistical analysis
   indicates that Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni, and Co adsorption depends on both
   duration of exposure and stratified water column, while Cu is influenced
   solely by duration of exposure to estuarine environment. Adsorbed TM
   amounts varied significantly among the plastic groups (Pellets, SUP and
   Lab), but not among different polymer types (PP, PE, PET and FEP). A
   noteworthy observation was the difference in the results of statistical
   analysis when investigating TM amounts expressed by plastic sample mass
   and by plastic sample surface area. Results expressed by plastic sample
   mass showed a difference between SUP group versus Pellets and Lab
   groups, while results expressed by plastic sample surface area
   distinguished Pellets group compared to other two groups. Therefore, we
   suggest presenting TM adsorption results in similar studies both by
   plastic sample mass and by plastic sample surface area. This approach
   will improve the understanding of TM adsorption on plastics, and enable
   more effective comparisons among the scientific literature dealing with
   plastics of different specific surface areas.},

Title = {Enhancing the Biodegradability, Water Solubility, and Thermal Properties
   of Polyvinyl Alcohol through Natural Polymer Blending: An Approach
   toward Sustainable Polymer Applications},

Abstract = {The escalating environmental crisis posed by single-use plastics
   underscores the urgent need for sustainable alternatives. This study
   provides an approach to introduce biodegradable polymer blends by
   blending synthetic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with natural polymers-corn
   starch (CS) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)-to address this
   challenge. Through a comprehensive analysis, including of the structure,
   mechanical strength, water solubility, biodegradability, and thermal
   properties, we investigated the enhanced performance of PVA-CS and
   PVA-HPMC blends over conventional polymers. Scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) findings of pure PVA and its blends were studied, and we found a
   complete homogeneity between the PVA and both types of natural polymers
   in the case of a high concentration of PVA, whereas at lower
   concentration of PVA, some granules of CS and HMPC appear in the SEM.
   Blending corn starch (CS) with PVA significantly boosts its
   biodegradability in soil environments, since adding starch of 50 w/w
   duplicates the rate of PVA biodegradation. Incorporating hydroxypropyl
   methylcellulose (HPMC) with PVA not only improves water solubility but
   also enhances biodegradation rates, as the addition of HPMC increases
   the biodegradation of pure PVA from 10 to 100\% and raises the water
   solubility from 80 to 100\%, highlighting the significant acceleration
   of the biodegradation process and water solubility caused by HPMC
   addition, making these blends suitable for a wide range of applications,
   from packaging and agricultural films to biomedical engineering. The
   thermal properties of pure PVA and its blends with natural were studied
   using diffraction scanning calorimetry (DSC). It is found that the glass
   transition temperature (Tg) increases after adding natural polymers to
   PVA, referring to an improvement in the molecular weight and
   intermolecular interactions between blend molecules. Moreover, the
   amorphous structure of natural polymers makes the melting temperature
   (TM) lessen after adding natural polymer, so the blends require lower
   temperature to remelt and be recycled again. For the mechanical
   properties, both types of natural polymer decrease the tensile strength
   and elongation at break, which overall weakens the mechanical properties
   of PVA. Our findings offer a promising pathway for the development of
   environmentally friendly polymers that do not compromise on performance,
   marking a significant step forward in polymer science's contribution to
   sustainability. This work presents detailed experimental and theoretical
   insights into novel polymerization methods and the utilization of
   biological strategies for advanced material design.},

Abstract = {Plastic pollution arising from single-use plastic bottles (SUPBs) and
   containers leads to the formation of micro/nanoplastics (NPs). These NPs
   raise concerns due to their potential toxicity and interactions with
   microorganisms. In various environments, including our digestive system,
   both microorganisms and plastics coexist. The interactions between these
   NPs and microorganisms can have far-reaching consequences, potentially
   affecting the ecosystems and human health. Therefore, understanding
   these interactions is crucial for addressing the challenges posed by
   plastic pollution. This study investigated the role of NPs in
   propagating antibiotic resistance (AR), specifically through outer
   membrane vesicles (OMVs), which is a mechanism that has not been fully
   explored to date in terms of NPs' effects. To explore this, NPs were
   synthesized using polyethylene terephthalate (PET) SUPBs, mimicking the
   natural chemical composition of environmental nanoplastics, unlike
   previous studies, which used pure PET, polystyrene (PS) or other pure
   plastic materials. The resulting PET bottle-derived nanoplastics
   (PBNPs), which exhibited diverse shapes and sizes (50-850 nm), were
   found to facilitate horizontal gene transfer (HGT) through
   transformation and outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), enabling the
   transport of plasmids among bacteria. In transformation, PBNPs
   physically carried plasmids across the bacterial membrane. In another
   scenario, PBNPs induced oxidative stress and bacterial surface damage,
   which led to the upregulation of stress response-associated genes and
   the escalation of OMV secretion in E. coli. This novel pathway
   highlights how PBNPs contribute to AR gene dissemination, potentially
   exacerbating the global antibiotic resistance crisis. Furthermore, PBNPs
   mediate cross-species gene transfer from E. coli to Lactobacillus
   acidophilus, underscoring their impact on diverse microorganisms,
   including those in the human gut. Our findings suggest that nanoplastics
   may be an unrecognized contributor to the rising tide of antibiotic
   resistance, with significant consequences for human health and the
   environment. Molecular analyses revealed the upregulated expression of
   genes associated with stress response and OMV secretion, offering deeper
   insights into the biological mechanisms affected by PBNPs. This study
   offers crucial insights into the interactions of NPs and microorganisms
   for developing strategies to address the ecological and health
   implications of nanoplastic contamination.},

Title = {Monitoring marine litter on Funchal beaches (Madeira Island): Insights
   for litter management},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {63},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Marine litter is a complex and multi-dimensional problem, with beach
   litter surveys being an important cost-effective tool for monitoring and
   assessing marine litter pollution. In Madeira Island (Portugal, NE
   Atlantic), a region awarded several times as `Europe's Leading Island
   Destination' and with a particular orography, there is a scarce
   understanding of the situation of marine debris. A two-year monitoring
   (July 2020 to April 2022) of macro-litter was conducted on two beaches
   in Funchal, the largest city and capital of the island. The abundance,
   composition, sources, and pathways of the stranded marine litter were
   assessed following OSPAR guidelines. During the two years, a total of
   14,265 items were recorded. The mean litter density was found to be 0.29
   items/m2 and the beaches' clean index ranged between `very clean' and
   `dirty'. Cigarette butts (30.9\%) and plastic objects (30.7\%) were the
   most frequent marine litter items, followed by paper/cardboard (9.2\%)
   and metal items (8.3\%). The composition of the litter showed that most
   of the monitored marine debris has a land-based source, with a strong
   contribution from smoking-related activities and littering in streams.
   By characterizing the waste and identifying its source, it was possible
   to propose integrated management actions at a local level. Outreach and
   raising awareness campaigns, together with actions to limit single-use
   plastic items and stimulate a circular economy, could contribute to
   limit marine litter on the studied island but also in other regions with
   similar profiles.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. This

Abstract = {Valorizing single-use plastic waste as an effective activator in
   environmental protection has gained great interest from policymakers,
   legislators, and scientific research communities. Herein, low-cost and
   highly porous alkali Fe/Mn-doped carbon nanomaterials derived from
   polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste (MF/cPET-x) were fabricated via
   facile pyrolysis and alkali-metal impregnation methods. Detailed
   characterizations of MF-cPET-x demonstrated that the ratio of alkaline
   impregnation and pyrolysis temperature affects the porous
   characteristics, content, and size of active sites, specific surface
   area, and yield of carbon residue/nanocomposite. The main aim of this
   study was to evaluate and optimize the MF/cPET-x applied for the
   detoxification of various kinds of pharmaceutical drugs (tetracycline,
   naproxen, paracetamol, and levofloxacin) and various dyestuff in their
   single, binary, ternary, and quaternary solutions. The magnetic porous
   MF/cPET-1 was found to show a most effective PMS activation for
   single/multiple toxic pollutants removal attaining levels >91.0 \% in a
   wide range of temperatures (5-35 degrees C) and pH (3.0-9.0), without
   significant detectable metal leaching (>0.16 mg L-1). The outstanding
   catalytic performance in complex water environments was mainly
   attributed to the deposition of Mn/Fe nanoparticles with small grain
   size on a polymeric scaffold, bimetal synergistic effect, high specific
   surface area, high stability, and excellent anti-interference capability
   against coexisting substances. Physicochemical properties of the
   recycled composite, masking, and EPR analyses confirmed that the
   dominant reactive species in the following order: O-1(2) > (OH)-O-center
   dot > SO4 center dot- > O-2(center dot-). This work offers a new and
   straightforward approach for preparing porous alloy composite from
   plastic waste for pollutant degradation in various water matrices.},

Title = {Influence of Choline Chloride/Urea and Glycerol Plasticizers on the
   Mechanical Properties of Thermoplastic Starch Plastics},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Bio-based plastics made of food-safe compostable materials, such as
   thermoplastic starch (TPS), can be designed into films that have
   potential to replace many non-biodegradable single-use plastic (SUP)
   items. TPS film characteristics, such as elongation at break and tensile
   strength, are largely affected by the choice of the plasticizers used in
   formulation. Our work identifies the mechanical properties and the
   chemical structural differences between TPS films made with two
   different plasticizer mixtures that have not yet been compared alongside
   one another: deep eutectic solvent choline chloride/urea (1:2) (CC:U)
   and glycerol with an acetic acid catalyst (AA:G). Potato-based TPS
   samples were formed by mixing each plasticizer with a consistent amount
   of potato starch and distilled water with heat. After gelation
   formation, the viscous TPS mixture was centrifuged to degas and
   extruded. Films were dried at controlled room temperature.
   Characterization included the tensile testing of coupons according to
   ASTM (American Society of Testing and Materials) standard D638,
   attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR)
   spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), melting point (MP), and scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM). The AA:G films displayed significantly higher
   tensile strength (M = 2.04 +/- 1.24 MPa) than the CC:U films (M = 0.18
   +/- 0.08 MPa); however, the CC:U films had higher elongation at break (M
   = 47.2 +/- 3.6\%) than the AA:G films (M = 31.1 +/- 12.6\%). This can be
   explained by the difference in functional groups, composition, and the
   degree of crystallinity evidenced by the FTIR, XRD, MP, and SEM results.
   Our findings suggest that potato-based TPS films with an AA:G
   plasticizer mixture hold promise for SUP applications that require more
   strength, while CC:U films may be more suited for wraps and bags that
   require flexibility. These innovations can aid to mitigate the
   environmental impact of harmful plastic waste.},

Abstract = {Background: Humans cannot avoid plastic exposure due to its ubiquitous
   presence in the natural environment. The waste generated is poorly
   biodegradable and exists in the form of MPs, which can enter the human
   body primarily through the digestive tract, respiratory tract, or
   damaged skin and accumulate in various tissues by crossing biological
   membrane barriers. There is an increasing amount of research on the
   health effects of MPs. Most literature reports focus on the impact of
   plastics on the respiratory, digestive, reproductive, hormonal, nervous,
   and immune systems, as well as the metabolic effects of MPs accumulation
   leading to epidemics of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and
   non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. MPs, as xenobiotics, undergo ADMET
   processes in the body, i.e., absorption, distribution, metabolism, and
   excretion, which are not fully understood. Of particular concern are the
   carcinogenic chemicals added to plastics during manufacturing or
   adsorbed from the environment, such as chlorinated paraffins,
   phthalates, phenols, and bisphenols, which can be released when absorbed
   by the body. The continuous increase in NMP exposure has accelerated
   during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic when there was a need to use single-use
   plastic products in daily life. Therefore, there is an urgent need to
   diagnose problems related to the health effects of MP exposure and
   detection. Methods: We collected eligible publications mainly from
   PubMed published between 2017 and 2024. Results: In this review, we
   summarize the current knowledge on potential sources and routes of
   exposure, translocation pathways, identification methods, and
   carcinogenic potential confirmed by in vitro and in vivo studies.
   Additionally, we discuss the limitations of studies such as
   contamination during sample preparation and instrumental limitations
   constraints affecting imaging quality and MPs detection sensitivity.
   Conclusions: The assessment of MP content in samples should be performed
   according to the appropriate procedure and analytical technique to
   ensure Quality and Control (QA/QC). It was confirmed that MPs can be
   absorbed and accumulated in distant tissues, leading to an inflammatory
   response and initiation of signaling pathways responsible for malignant
   transformation.},

Title = {Evaluation of community behavior regarding the risk of plastic
   micro-pollution on the environment health},
Journal = {GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Plastic pollution is increasing globally
   along with the growing consumption patterns of the global community,
   leading to practicality (social behavior). The primary contributors to
   pollution are single-use plastic (SUP) items and inadequate waste
   management techniques. This research attempts to examine local
   communities' determinants and behavioral patterns regarding plastic
   waste management.METHODS: This cross-sectional analytical study includes
   195 respondents and conducted at Antang Lake, Makassar. The social
   sciences statistical package version 26 was used to perform chi-square
   tests and multiple regression analysis to examine the main elements
   influencing individual behavior toward plastic waste management. A
   survey instrument was provided to participants for data collection.
   FINDINGS: The chi-square test results show that the knowledge variable
   has a statistically significant relationship with plastic waste
   management behavior at home, with a test statistical value of 0.002.
   Respondents with limited knowledge are 2.603 times more likely to have
   poor household plastic waste management behavior than those with
   substantial knowledge. The knowledge variable is also significantly
   related to household plastic waste management behavior simultaneously
   with a statistical test value of 0.000, showing a strong relationship.
   This variable influences 11.8 percent of the behavior in question.
   Attitude and action variables do not have a significant relationship
   partially or simultaneously with household plastic waste management
   behavior.CONCLUSION: Increased plastic consumption has led to
   microplastic pollution, environmental damage, and deteriorating health
   conditions. Thus, intervention is required to improve optimal waste
   management behavior in the community. Increasing awareness about
   environmental management and educating the public on the impact of
   microplastics on family health can contribute to enhanced knowledge
   awareness. This research aims encourage greater awareness of
   environmental condition to minimize toxicity resulting from the negative
   impacts of plastic waste.},

Abstract = {Plastics account for 60-80\% of marine debris worldwide, and, in 2021,
   Malaysia was the 28th largest plastic polluter in the world. In light of
   this finding, the Malaysian government has launched the Roadmap Towards
   Zero Single-Use Plastics 2018-2030 and the Plastics Sustainability
   Roadmap 2021-2030 to reduce plastic pollution and implement a circular
   economy for Malaysia. A comprehensive database of the status of plastic
   pollution in Malaysia is needed to achieve this target. This study aims
   to record the presence of macro- (>2.5 cm) and mesoplastic (0.5-2.5 cm)
   debris at selected beaches in the northern Strait of Malacca. All study
   sites are publicly accessible beaches (Pulau Songsong, Teluk Aling, and
   Pulau Gazumbo) except Pulau Lembu, which is in a Marine Protected Area
   (MPA). The debris was collected from predetermined transects on the
   beach and categorised according to its form and economic market segments
   in Malaysia. Most of the macro- (53-75\% of total mass) and mesoplastics
   (52-80\% of the total number) were accumulated in the backshore area.
   Public beaches such as Pulau Gazumbo and Pulau Songsong recorded the
   highest abundance of macroplastics, with 7.32 g/m(2) and 9.77 g/m(2),
   respectively. Teluk Aling recorded the lowest abundance of macroplastics
   (3.58 g/m(2)) but the highest in mesoplastics (0.55 items/m(2)). Most of
   the macroplastics found were packaging plastics such as plastic bottles,
   containers, and polystyrene foam debris. Although Pulau Lembu is an MPA,
   the amount of macroplastics found was considerably high (7.17 g/m(2)).
   Based on the beach cleanliness index, Pulau Gazumbo (-3.99) was the
   dirtiest site, followed by Pulau Lembu (-2.92) and Pulau Songsong
   (-2.85), while Teluk Aling (-1.63) was the cleanest site, which can
   explain the amount of macroplastic debris found. However, all the study
   sites' cleanliness may not be ideal, as the indexes were less than zero
   due to the low availability of waste bins and insufficient frequency of
   beach cleaning. This may not be able to curb the effects of high
   anthropogenic activities conducted in addition to uncontrollable natural
   factors.},

Title = {Commercial fishing vessels as marine-based sources of plastic pollution:
   The Namibian perspective},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {258},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution in the marine ecosystem and their sources have been
   widely investigated, however some parts of the world remain under
   studied. Herein, we report on plastic pollution in the Namibian marine
   ecosystem, based on data collected by fisheries observers between 2003
   and 2020 during commercial fishing activities. A total of 79 plastic
   pollution incidents were reported between 2003 and 2020, which consisted
   of unspecified non- biodegradable objects (55.7\%), unspecified plastic
   items (25.3\%), fishing gear (8.9\%), plastic bottles (5.0\%), plastic
   gloves (1.3\%) and single-use plastic bags (3.8\%). We found no
   significant Pearson correlation between the number of disposal incidents
   and the fisheries observer coverage (r = 0.3254, df = 14, p = 0.2187).
   The spatial analysis in the disposal of non-biodegradable objects show a
   fair distribution along the Namibian coast with more concentrations
   around latitude 180S, 220S, and 260S. We conclude that fishing vessels
   are important marine- based sources of plastic pollution, highlighting a
   continuous need to raise awareness over the fishing industry, in
   particular seafarers, on plastic use and management. The study expands
   the plastic pollution knowledge by quantifying incidents of plastic
   pollution, plastic litter composition, and identifying spatial
   distribution in the Namibian waters, thus, to the best of our knowledge,
   represents a baseline for studies on marine plastic pollution in this
   oceanic region. Identifying sources of marine plastic litter and
   providing a spatial picture is a step closer to develop and implement
   specific regulatory tools to combat marine pollution.},

Abstract = {Single use plastic packaging and its environmental impacts have received
   much attention over the last few years from governments, businesses and
   consumers. One option to reduce plastic packaging waste and its
   associated environmental impacts is to shift towards circular business
   models, supplying reusable packaging options that are used many times
   before being recycled. One technical barrier to the implementation of
   plastic food packaging reuse is the need to effectively clean the packs
   and provide cleaning assurance to prevent the possibility of product
   crossover. This research investigated the feasibility of using
   Ultraviolet Fluorescence imaging to optically detect residual food
   fouling and thus assuring cleanliness in the case example of margarine
   spread tubs. Processing of obtained images was carried out usingMATLAB
   (R) applying Otsu's thresholding method. It was established that for the
   current setup the minimum detectable quantity of fouling was of the
   order 10(-4) g/mm(2). The assessment process was correlated against that
   of Adenosine Triphosphate assay, an industry-standard process for
   assessing the cleanliness of food contact surfaces. The implications of
   the investigated technique overcome one barrier to plastic food
   packaging reuse on an industrial scale. Fast and reliable fouling
   evaluation of every pack will underpin business and consumer trust in
   such a circular material flow. The established technique has the
   potential to form part of the wider reuse system for polymer packaging.
   Implications on optical detection optimization, packaging design, and
   suitability for automation are discussed alongside wider food supply
   chain considerations.},

Abstract = {This work provides an overview of the importance of recycling PET waste
   to reduce the environmental impact of plastic waste, conserve natural
   resources and energy, and create jobs in the recycling industry. Many
   countries have implemented regulations and initiatives to promote the
   recycling of PET waste and reduce plastic pollution, such as extended
   producer responsibility (EPR) systems, bans on certain single-use
   plastics, and deposit-return systems for plastic bottles. The article
   further underscores the versatility of recycled PET, as it can be
   transformed into various products such as fibers, sheets, film, and
   strapping. These recycled materials find applications in numerous
   sectors including clothing, carpets, upholstery, and industrial fibers.
   Recognizing the importance of collaboration among governments,
   industries, and individuals, we emphasize the need for sustainable PET
   waste management practices and the promotion of recycled materials. The
   article also provides information on India's experiences with PET waste
   management and regulations in other countries. It is important to note
   that the global production and consumption of PET have increased
   significantly in recent years, with the packaging industry being the
   largest consumer of PET. This has resulted in a significant increase in
   the generation of PET waste, which poses a significant environmental and
   health hazard if not managed properly. PET waste can end up in
   landfills, where it can take hundreds of years to decompose, or it can
   end up in the oceans, where it can harm marine life and the environment.
   Therefore, the proper management and recycling of PET waste are
   essential to mitigate these negative impacts. In terms of India's
   experiences with PET waste management, several initiatives have been
   implemented to promote the recycling of PET waste. For example, the
   government has launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan campaign, which aims
   to promote cleanliness and sanitation in the country to promote waste
   segregation and recycling.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Plastic waste in Indonesia increased
   significantly during the Covid-19 pandemic. With this surge in plastic
   consumption and waste, awareness of environmental sanitation becomes
   essential, especially regarding the use of plastic. Society must
   consider the impact of single-use plastics and implement good plastic
   waste management. This study aimed to determine the environmental
   awareness of a community and what factors contributed to its plastic
   waste utilization activities during the Covid-19 pandemic.METHODS: The
   data collection in this study was conducted using a questionnaire with a
   crosssectional analytical approach. The study was conducted in Makassar
   City, South Sulawesi, the largest city in Eastern Indonesia, and
   purposive sampling was used to determine selected respondents. Data
   analysis was carried out using chi-square to identify partial
   relationships and logistic regression to distinguish relationships
   simultaneously.FINDINGS: This study found that 53.2 percent of
   respondents frequently used plastic during the Covid-19 pandemic.
   Partial relationship analysis showed that general knowledge about waste
   and its impact was not significantly related to plastic use activities
   during the pandemic. Meanwhile, knowledge about plastic use during the
   pandemic, knowledge of protecting the environment, attitudes toward
   plastic use, attitudes toward waste management, behavior toward plastic
   use, and behavior regarding processing plastic waste were significantly
   related to plastic use activities during the Covid-19 pandemic, with
   respective test values of 0.000 each. Willingness to pay was also
   significantly related to plastic use activities during the pandemic,
   with a test value of 0.007. Simultaneous analysis showed that knowledge
   about plastic use during the pandemic was related to plastic use
   activities during the same time frame, with an odds ratio value of 0.398
   and a negative relationship direction. Plastic wasteprocessing behavior
   was the most dominant factor influencing plastic use activities during
   the Covid-19 pandemic, with a test value of 0.000 and a positive
   relationship direction. Respondents who did not have good waste
   management behavior were 3.963 times more likely to use plastic
   frequently in their daily activities during the pandemic.CONCLUSION: The
   study results show the importance of increasing knowledge regarding
   plastic use and waste management. Good knowledge will intervene in
   attitudes that encourage good behavior. This study focuses on the
   relationship between plastic processing behavior and the intensity of
   plastic use during the Covid-19 pandemic. It emphasizes the need for
   intervention in the form of education about the importance of protecting
   the environment and providing facilities that enable people to implement
   good waste-processing behavior.},

Title = {Assessing Pro-Environmental Behaviour towards Plastics among Staff and
   Students at a South African University},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Plastic pollution is a global issue of concern, with all environmental
   realms contaminated by plastics. Human consumption as well as management
   of daily plastics use can play a significant role to control this global
   environmental problem. Thus, understanding public perceptions about
   plastic consumption and pollution is vital to engage society in
   solutions to reduce the associated environmental impact. This study
   explores the perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs of a university
   community towards plastic consumption and pollution. We employed online
   questionnaires, which had 248 respondents in the end, and data was
   analysed using a combination of Chi-Squared and Spearman correlation
   tests. We observed that staff members (i.e., lecturers) had a greater
   awareness of long-term plastic waste impacts and were more likely to
   take steps to reduce their plastic use in their daily routines. About
   50\% of staff members and 14.8\% of students indicated that their main
   source of information was scientific publications, followed by Google
   (8.3\% of staff members, 24\% of students). Furthermore, they were also
   more likely to implement policies and procedures that promote
   sustainability and reduce waste. Approximately 54.5\% of staff members
   and 56.4\% of students highlighted that they did not know of any tools
   to help reduce plastic pollution, with 36.4\% of staff members and
   20.5\% of students indicating that they did not know of any intervention
   methods. In comparison, students were more focused on convenience and
   did not have the same level of understanding or concern about the
   environmental impact of plastics as they were more likely to use
   single-use plastics, without considering the potential environmental
   harm. Hence, to bridge this gap in perception, educational institutions
   should take proactive steps to educate both staff and students about the
   importance of reducing plastic waste and promoting sustainability
   through the provision of educational materials, organising awareness
   campaigns and events, and implementing policies that encourage
   responsible plastic use.},

Title = {Environmental taxation of plastic bags and substitutes: Balancing marine
   pollution and climate change},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {359},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Several countries have imposed either a ban or a tax on single-use
   plastic packaging, motivated by their contribution to marine plastic
   pollution. This may lead consumers to opt for similar unregulated
   substitutes, potentially undermining or even counteracting the intended
   effect of the policy instrument. The purpose of this study is to
   theoretically and empirically compare the environmental and welfare
   effects of the first-best Pigouvian taxes on both plastic bags and a
   substitute (paper bags), with two alternative second-best policy
   instruments: a tax on plastic products alone, and a common uniform tax
   on all packaging materials. The empirical analysis accounts for two
   different types of environmental externalities from the use of both bag
   types: marine pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. It also compares
   results for two countries, Denmark and the USA, which differ in the
   demand for plastic and paper bags. The theoretical analysis shows that a
   unilateral tax on plastic bags should equal the marginal environmental
   damage of plastic bags minus a fraction of the marginal environmental
   cost of paper bags, hence being lower than the Pigouvian tax. The
   optimal common tax should equal a weighted average of the marginal
   environmental damage of the two bag types and would be lower than the
   Pigouvian tax on plastics if the marginal external cost of plastic bags
   exceeds that for paper bags. The empirical analysis shows that for
   default parameters, the variation in tax level across the studied
   scenarios is small. It also shows that if Pigouvian taxes cannot be
   implemented, a common uniform tax on both bag types would result in a
   higher welfare gain than a tax on plastic bags alone. Sensitivity
   analysis reveals that the level of the second-best taxes and their
   associated environmental and welfare impacts are sensitive to
   assumptions regarding the littering rate and decay rate of plastic bags
   in the marine environment.},

Title = {Advancement of an Environmentally Friendly and Innovative Sustainable
   Rubber Wrap Film with Superior Sealing Properties},
Journal = {POLYMERS},

Abstract = {Common kitchen wraps like plastic and aluminum foil create significant
   environmental burdens. Plastic wrap, typically made from non-renewable
   fossil fuels, often ends up in landfills for centuries, breaking down
   into harmful microplastics. Aluminum foil, while effective, requires a
   large amount of energy to produce, and recycling it at home can be
   impractical due to food residue. A promising new alternative,
   low-nitrosamine rubber wrap film, aims to reduce waste by offering a
   reusable option compared to traditional single-use plastic wrap. The
   film is environmentally friendly, durable, and effective in sealing
   containers and keeping food fresh or crispy. The raw materials used to
   make the product were studied, namely fresh and concentrated natural
   rubber latex. No nitrosamines were found in either the fresh or
   concentrated latex, which is important as nitrosamines are known to be
   carcinogenic. The absence of nitrosamines in the raw materials suggests
   that the universal rubber wrap film is safe for use. In this study, the
   rubber formulation and properties of rubber used to make rubber wrap
   film were studied. The content of additives affecting the rubber
   properties was varied to find the optimum rubber formulation for making
   rubber wrap films. The rubber formulation with the least amount of
   chemicals that met the following criteria was selected: tensile strength
   of at least 15 MPa, elongation at break of at least 600\%, and
   nitrosamine content below 6 ppm. It was found experimentally that the
   optimum rubber formulation for making a translucent rubber film had 0.7
   phr zinc oxide and 1.0 phr sulfur. Performance tests revealed the rubber
   wrap film's superior sealing capabilities. Its elasticity allows for a
   tighter fit on containers, effectively conforming to various shapes and
   creating an optimal seal compared to plastic wrap and aluminum foil. The
   results of this study provide valuable information for developing a
   universal rubber wrap film that is safe with low nitrosamines.},

Title = {MarILCA characterization factors for microplastic impacts in life cycle
   assessment: Physical effects on biota from emissions to aquatic
   environments},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Although plastics emissions pose hazards to ecosystem quality, life
   cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies do not yet include quantification
   of the potential impacts of plastic leakage. To address this gap in LCA,
   the MarILCA working group was founded. This work contributes to
   MarILCA's output by providing characterization factors for assessing the
   impacts of aquatic (marine and freshwater) microplastic emissions
   through the impact category of physical effects on biota and ultimately
   the ecosystem quality damage category. First, the existing exposure and
   effect factor (EEF) for micro-and nanoplastic emissions in aquatic
   compartments (Lavoie et al., 2021) is updated using additional toxicity
   data, delivering a generic EEF of 1067.5 PAF m3/kgin compartment.
   Second, fate factors (FFs) are developed for eleven different polymers
   (EPS, PS, PA/Nylon, PP, HDPE, LDPE, PET, PVC, PLA, PHA, TRWP), three
   shapes (sphere/microbead, cylinder/microfiber, microplastic film
   fragments) and five sizes (1, 10, 100, 1000, 5000 \& mu;m). To calculate
   the FFs, a detailed degradation model and a simplified sedimentation
   model are proposed. Polymer density and size play a major role in the
   fate, whereas the influence of the shape is less relevant. Ultimately,
   the EEF and FFs are combined to deliver midpoint and endpoint
   characterization factors (CFs). Uncertainty is calculated with Monte
   Carlo analysis. Default and archetype-based CFs are recommended to LCA
   practitioners in case the details of emission parameters are not fully
   known. CFs for 1 \& mu;m microplastic size are proposed as interim CFs
   for nanoplastic emissions. Finally, endpoint CFs are tested in case
   studies within the UNEP report ``Supermarket food packaging and its
   alternatives: Recommendations from life cycle assessments{''}, assessing
   the relative magnitude of potential microplastic impacts compared to
   complete LCA results. The case studies confirm that the proposed
   methodology contributes to filling a gap in LCA and can assist
   environmental decision-making on single-use plastics and their
   alternatives.},

Title = {Sustainable barrier coatings for paperboard packaging: Effect of
   VeoVa-10 on 2-EHA and MMA containing water-based emulsions},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN ORGANIC COATINGS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {198},

Abstract = {Developing environmentally benign barrier coatings may provide a
   sustainable alternative to the packaging sector and facilitate
   minimizing the consumption of single-use plastics in packaging. The
   synthesis of seven different water-based (W/B) emulsions was achieved
   via seeded emulsion polymerization using 2-Ethylhexylacrylate (2-EHA),
   methyl methacrylate (MMA), and a varying amount of vinyl ester of
   VersaticTM acid 10 (VeoVa-10) to impart the hydrophobic properties.
   Potassium persulfate (K2S2O8) was used as an initiator. Antifoaming
   agent and biocide were also added to improve the application and
   shelf-life of these coatings. The coatings were evaluated by conducting
   various analytical tests, including pH measurement, viscosity
   assessment, determination of solid content, measurement of drying time,
   evaluation of gloss, water absorption testing using Cobb's Test, and
   assessment of oil and grease resistance via the Kit Test. The coatings
   were also analyzed using advanced characterization techniques, including
   Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Fourier Transform Infrared
   Spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Zetasizer Nano
   ZS, and contact angle analysis. The results indicated that as the amount
   of VeoVa-10 increases in barrier coatings, the coated paperboard
   demonstrated improved moisture and oil/grease resistance compared to the
   control paperboard (uncoated). Furthermore, the coatings were also
   applied on paperboard trays and stored at 0 degrees C and 90 degrees C
   to confirm their practical usefulness, a careful examination after an
   hour showed no leakage/seepage of hot and cold water through the coated
   trays, unlike the uncoated ones. Barrier coatings offer sustainable and
   eco-friendly options that could positively impact the packaging
   industry, helping reduce environmental footprints while enhancing
   packaging performance.},

Abstract = {The consumption of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has experienced a
   surge in recent times, owing to the widespread use of single-use plastic
   bottles, particularly in the context of beverages and drinking water.
   PET, a thermoplastic polymer, is known for its recyclability, and the
   recycled variant is referred to as rPET. The incorporation of rPET in
   fiber manufacturing is favored due to its cost-effectiveness, and the
   functionalized rPET fibers present an innovative product that can be
   used in a variety of applications. This study aimed to functionalize
   rPET fibers using the spun-bond technique, imparting antibacterial and
   flame-retardant properties, which are commonly employed in thermal
   insulator products. Nano zinc oxide (nano-ZnO) was used to confer
   antibacterial functionality, while phosphorus flame retardant (PFR) was
   used to impart flame-retardant properties. The core-sheath bicomponent
   fiber structure was employed to achieve the desired outcomes. The
   extrusion process was used to incorporate PFR and ZnO as the core and
   sheath components, respectively, at various ratios. The presence of
   nano-ZnO on the fiber shell was confirmed by the EDX data. The flame
   retardant study was utilized to observe the level of burning damage. The
   findings of the study demonstrated that increasing the percentage of PFR
   (maximum 8\%) resulted in a significant decrease in the damage distance
   of the nonwoven material, with reductions of up to 60\% was observed.
   Furthermore, the results of the antibacterial test indicated that the
   inclusion of an additional 3 wt\% of ZnO resulted in a considerable
   reduction of the bacteria S. aureus and K. pneumoniae by about 99.96 and
   98.79\%, respectively. Based on the results obtained, it was determined
   that the most effective functionalized fiber was synthesized by
   including 3 wt\% of ZnO and 5 wt\% of PFR. Moreover, the incorporation
   of varying proportions of additives resulted in modifications to the
   mechanical and thermal characteristics of the fibers. This work
   highlights the potential of functionalized rPET bicomponent fibers as
   viable candidates for thermal insulator products. The utilization of
   functionalized rPET bicomponent fibers as a sustainable alternative for
   thermal insulator products showcases the commitment to environmentally
   friendly solutions, contributing to the overall goal of sustainability
   in the manufacturing industry.},

Title = {Adverse health effects of exposure to plastic, microplastics and their
   additives: environmental, legal and policy implications for Israel},

Abstract = {BackgroundIsrael is a regional ``hotspot{''} of plastic pollution, with
   little discussion of potential adverse health effects from exposure to
   plastic. This review aims to stimulate discussion and drive policy by
   focusing on these adverse health effects.Main bodyPlastics are synthetic
   polymers containing additives which can leach from food- and
   beverage-contact plastic into our food and beverages, and from plastic
   textiles onto our skin. Plastics persist in the environment for
   generations, fragmenting into MNPs: Micro (1 micron-5 mm)-Nano (1 nm-1
   micron)-Plastic, which contaminate our atmosphere, water, and food
   chain. MNP can enter the human body through ingestion, inhalation and
   touch. MNP < 10 microns can cross epithelial barriers in the respiratory
   and gastrointestinal systems, and fragments < 100 nm can cross intact
   skin, enabling entry into body tissues. MNP have been found in multiple
   organs of the human body. Patients with MNP in atheromas of carotid
   arteries have increased risk of a combined measure of stroke,
   cardiovascular disease, and death. Toxic additives to plastics include
   bisphenols, phthalates, and PFAS, endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs)
   which cause dysregulation of thyroid function, reproduction, and
   metabolism, includ-ing increased risk of obesity, diabetes,
   endometriosis, cancer, and decreased fertility, sperm count and quality.
   Fetal exposure to EDCs is associated with increased rates of
   miscarriages, prematurity and low birth weight. There is likely no safe
   level of exposure to EDCs, with increasing evidence of
   trans-generational and epigenetic effects. There are several existing
   Israeli laws to reduce plastic use and waste. Taxes on single-use
   plastic (SUP) were recently cancelled. There are many gaps in regulatory
   standards for food-, beverage- and child- safe plastic. Existing
   standards are poorly enforced.ConclusionReduction in production and use
   of plastic, promotion of recycling and reduction of leaching of toxic
   additives into our food and beverages are essential policy goals.
   Specific recommendations: Periodic monitoring of MNP in bottled
   beverages, food, indoor air; Strengthen enforcement of standards for
   food-, beverage-, and child-safe plastic; Renew tax on SUPs; National
   ban on SUP at public beaches, nature reserves and parks; Ban products
   manufactured with MNP; Increase research on sources and health outcomes
   of exposure to MNP and EDCs.},

Title = {Prevalence of Plastic and Hardware Foreign Bodies among Goats at Malawi
   Markets},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Goat smallholdings are common in both rural and urban
   areas of Malawi, and are kept as a food source and as investments to
   improve livelihoods. However, goats are known to forage on indigestible
   items that can negatively impact health and lead to a loss of productive
   performance. To date, no studies have estimated the prevalence of
   pollution among Malawi goats despite issues with waste management. To
   this end, we sought to survey the frequency of plastic and other
   indigestible foreign bodies among goats slaughtered by informal market
   butcher stands in five districts spanning Malawi. Most of the butchers
   surveyed identified plastic during slaughter (80\%) while almost half
   (45.3\%) identified other indigestible objects (hardware). Plastic was
   found by butchers in all districts and across rural and urban settings.
   While being less common than plastic, the hardware noted by butchers
   included sharps such as needles and bicycle spokes. When purchasing,
   butchers do consider animal health important, but 70.7\% consider injury
   status as less or not important. Overall, this study highlights the
   issues of pollution among smallholder goats and demonstrates the need
   for further study to address the impacts of pollution on animal health
   and knock-on impacts on smallholder livelihoods.Abstract Smallholder
   goat production plays a major role in rural livelihoods and food
   security in Malawi, but suffers from drastic and unpredictable
   production losses. While goat production is closely linked to
   small-scale local markets for slaughter and butchering, the perspectives
   of butchers and their potential as a source of animal health information
   are largely untapped. Butchers can provide insights into goat health
   status at slaughter as well as issues that go unseen before slaughter,
   such as the presence of indigestible foreign bodies (IFBs). IFBs include
   solid materials such as plastics and hardware (metals, stones, and other
   hard objects) that cause foreign body syndrome and can lead to
   impaction, oedema, malnutrition, and death. To estimate the presence of
   IFBs, 150 market stand butchers were surveyed across five districts in
   Malawi, focusing on a distinction between hardware and single-use
   plastics, which are still widely present in Malawi despite bans on
   production. Most butchers found plastic IFBs (80.7\%), with over half
   (56.7\%) reporting plastic IFBs recently among the past five slaughters.
   Hardware IFBs were less common, reported by 45.3\% of butchers. While
   some butchers commented on the impact of IFBs on meat quality metrics
   ex-post, the majority observed no differences. While butchers
   unanimously considered health to be an important characteristic when
   sourcing goats, 70.7\% consider injury status to be less important or
   not important. Overall, this study highlights the issue of anthropogenic
   waste pollution on goat production in Malawi and demonstrates the
   potential for the surveillance of goat health at market.},

Title = {Distinct dynamics in mountain watersheds: Exploring mercury and
   microplastic pollution-Unraveling the influence of atmospheric
   deposition, human activities, and hydrology},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {242},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {The intensification of human activities all around the globe has led to
   the spread of micropollutants in high-mountain freshwater environments.
   We therefore aimed to assess the geospatial distribution and determine
   the potential sources of (total-) mercury (THg) and microplastics (MPs)
   in mountain freshwater ecosystems. To do so, we analyzed THg and MP
   concentrations in brown trout, biofilm, and sediments from lotic and
   lentic ecosystems in the Pyrenees - all subjected to different types of
   human pressure. Additionally, we assessed the potential impacts of these
   pollutants on fish, and explored the bioindication capacity of brown
   trout (Salmo trutta fario) and biofilm regarding THg and MP pollution.
   For the first time, we measured concentrations of MPs trapped in the
   matrix of freshwater biofilm. Our results suggest that THg in the
   Pyrenees might be explained by both legacy (regional) and distant
   sources, in combination with environmental characteristics such as the
   presence of peatlands or streamwater physicochemistry, while MPs in fish
   are linked to recent local pollution sources such as single-use
   plastics. In contrast, MPs in biofilm matrix and sediments indicate a
   combination of distant (i.e., atmospheric deposition) and recent local
   pollution sources. Moreover, hydrodynamics and plastic density likely
   control MP distribution in rivers. Based on Fulton's condition factor,
   we also found that higher THg concentrations caused a negative impact on
   fish health (K < 1), while no impact of MPs could be seen. Therefore, we
   suggest that brown trout and biofilm can serve as bioindicators of
   atmospheric deposition of THg in high-altitude lakes and that biofilm is
   a reliable bioindicator to assess MP pollution in remote environments.
   Brown trout may also act as a bioindicator of MP pollution, but only
   efficiently in more polluted areas.},

Title = {Marine degradation and ecotoxicity of conventional, recycled and
   compostable plastic bags},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {351},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Plastic bags are currently a major component of marine litter, causing
   aesthetical nuisance, and undesirable effects on marine fauna that
   ingest them or are entangled. Plastic litter also rises concern on the
   ecotoxicological effects due to the potential toxicity of the chemical
   additives leached in aquatic environments. Conventional plastic bags are
   made of polyethylene, either from first use or recycled, but regulations
   restricting single-use plastics and limiting lightweight carrier bags
   (<50 mu m thickness) have fostered the replacement of thin PE bags by
   compostable materials advertised as safer for the environment. In this
   study, we assess the degradation of commercially available plastic bags
   in marine conditions at two scales: aquariums (60 days) and outdoors
   flowthrough mesocosm (120 days). Strength at break point and other
   tensile strength parameters were used as ecologically relevant endpoints
   to track mechanical degradation. Ecotoxicity has been assessed along the
   incubation period using the sensitive Paracentrotus lividus embryo test.
   Whereas PE bags did not substantially lose their mechanical properties
   within the 60 d aquarium exposures, compostable bags showed remarkable
   weight loss and tensile strength decay, some of them fragmenting in the
   aquarium after 3-4 weeks. Sediment pore water inoculum promoted a more
   rapid degradation of compostable bags, while nutrient addition pattern
   did not affect the degradation rate. Longer-term mesocosms exposures
   supported these findings, as well as pointed out the influence of the
   microbial processes on the degradation efficiency of
   compostable/bioplastic bags. Compostable materials, in contrast toPE,
   showed moderate toxicity on sea-urchin larvae, partially associated to
   degradation of these materials, but the environmental implications of
   these findings remain to be assessed. These methods proved to be useful
   to classify plastic materials, according to their degradability in
   marine conditions, in a remarkably shorter time than current standard
   tests and promote new materials safer for the marine fauna.},

Title = {Regional assessment of trash in Southern California coastal watersheds,
   United States},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {Trash impairment of watersheds has been recognized as a worldwide
   environmental problem. Trash monitoring in streams and rivers is
   necessary to enhance our understanding of its effects on freshwater
   habitats and the role of streams as a conduit for transport to marine
   environments. Southern California, with a population of over 22 million,
   is home to nearly 7,400 km of wadeable streams in watersheds spanning a
   variety of land uses, making it an ideal region to study the extent and
   magnitude of trash and trash types (plastic, metal, glass, etc.) and
   identify relationships between land use and the amount of trash. These
   data can be used to develop mitigation strategies and evaluate
   management successes. We found that 77\% of Southern California's
   coastal stream kilometers contained trash, with an estimated stock of 7
   million pieces of trash. Of the types enumerated, plastic trash was the
   most ubiquitous, present in 69\% of stream kilometers, and the most
   abundant, with an estimated stock of over 4.3 million pieces of plastic.
   The most common items were single-use plastic containers, wrappers, and
   plastic bags. Urban land use was associated with the greatest extent and
   magnitude of trash, with levels nearly double those found in open land
   uses. Trash was strongly associated with indicators of human activity
   and development in watersheds. Road density and proximity to roads and
   parking lots were strongly associated with increased trash in
   watersheds. This survey also suggested that management actions had a
   positive effect on trash count. After the previous trash survey in
   Southern California streams in 2011-2013, a statewide ban on plastic
   bags was implemented in 2016. We found a significant decrease in the
   number of plastic bags within streams in the present survey compared to
   the previous survey.},

Title = {LCA and Emergy Approach to Evaluate the Environmental Performance of
   Plastic Bags from Fossil and Renewable Sources with the Function of
   Conditioning MSW},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {This study aimed to compare the environmental performance of plastic
   bags made of three different polymers, considering two product
   functions: carrying goods and packing municipal solid waste. The three
   polymers studied were HDPE, LDPE, and thermoplastic starch (TPS). Life
   cycle assessment and emergy accounting were used to evaluate the
   environmental performance of each scenario in analysis. To develop this
   research, eight scenarios were created to represent the customs of use
   and consumption in the Brazilian population. The LCA results showed
   that, in general, the scenarios with HDPE plastic bags presented the
   best environmental performances, while those with TPS presented the
   worst. The processes that contributed most to these results,
   representing 70\% or more of the environmental impact in each impact
   category, are related to the use of raw materials, electricity, and
   water for the manufacture of plastic bags and the treatment in
   landfills. In other words, the fact that TPS has a mass around six times
   greater than that of HDPE and two times greater than that of LDPE ends
   up leaving this type of polymer with the worst environmental
   performance. In the comparative analysis of scenarios for the same
   polymer, scenarios that involve the use and reuse of plastic bags
   present the lowest potential environmental impacts. In contrast, those
   related to the use and disposal in landfills present the highest
   possible environmental impacts. The results of emergy accounting showed
   that the HDPE scenarios had the lowest total emergy flow, ranging from
   1.77 x 1013 seJ to 2.40 x 1013 seJ. In contrast, the LDPE scenarios had
   the highest total emergy flow, ranging from 1.15 x 1014 to 1.21 x 1014
   seJ. Although LDPE had the highest total emergy flow values, these
   results are similar to those obtained by the fossil resource scarcity
   impact category, which focuses on resource consumption analysis. Thus,
   through a real approach to the use of plastic bags and solid waste
   management in the Brazilian context, this study brings essential
   insights to direct public policies related to the consumption of plastic
   bags.},

Title = {The use of chain extenders as processing aids in the valorization of
   single-use polylactide (PLA) products by rotomolding},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},

Abstract = {Biodegradable plastics in single-use products have increased in
   popularity as a way to reduce the negative environmental impact of
   conventional plastics and meet the tightening law regulations. However,
   their recyclability needs to be assessed, as the environmental behavior
   of single-use plastics, even if compostable, is not negligible.
   Polylactide (PLA) is susceptible to thermal, oxidative, hydrolytic, and
   mechanical degradation during reprocessing, so the conditions of such
   cycles must be accurately controlled. The necessity of using additives
   to reduce such degradations during rotational molding, a process with
   long cycle times and oxidizing atmosphere, has been demonstrated. Chain
   extenders based on a carbodiimide (Bioadimide (R) 100 - KI), a methylene
   diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), and a polystyrene-acrylic copolymer
   (Joncryl (R) ADR-4368c - J) have been added to post-consumer PLA wastes.
   It has been demonstrated that these three chain extenders enabled
   obtaining a higher molecular weight of the reprocessed polymer, compared
   to the similar to 50\% reduction for the neat PLA. The use of
   carbodiimide yielded the most similar performance to that of unprocessed
   raw material. All samples provided adequate thermal stability and
   processing parameters for the rotational molding. Carbodiimide is
   considered the most efficient additive, as it increases the molecular
   mass of the polymer as it remains unchanged after processing. Similarly,
   KI-modified PLA rheological behavior remains unchanged after processing,
   which means this compound can reduce thermooxidative and hydrolytic
   degradation reactions. Thus contributing to the achievement of improved
   processability and better performance; in particular, impact strength
   increased from 1.06 +/- 0.56 for PLA to 8.12 +/- 2.28 kJ/m(2) for
   KI-modified PLA, and toughness of 5.36 +/- 1.61 to 61.49 +/- 8.01
   J/mm(3), respectively, leading to rotomolded items without structural
   defects. On the opposite, the use of Joncryl (R) and MDI led to
   structural defects in the rotomolded parts despite a higher molecular
   weight of the polymer, which resulted in poor mechanical properties,
   although better than PLA without any additive. All three chain extenders
   resulted in an amorphous PLA structure with increased glass transition
   temperature and improved thermal stability, which correlated with the
   reduced emissions of volatile compounds compared to neat recycled PLA.
   The presented findings significantly contribute to a better
   understanding of PLA and its modifications at a molecular scale required
   for its efficient and possibly environmentally burden-free reprocessing.
   Gathered knowledge will be crucial for optimizing its environmental
   performance and widening its applications, particularly in a process
   with long cycle times and oxidative character, such as rotational
   molding.},

Title = {Opposition to Banning Cigarette Filters and the Belief That Removing
   Filters Makes Cigarettes Much More Harmful Among Adults Who Smoke:
   Findings From the 2022 International Tobacco Control Four Country
   Smoking and Vaping Survey},
Journal = {NICOTINE \& TOBACCO RESEARCH},

Abstract = {ntroduction: In line with historical tobacco industry marketing claims,
   many consumers perceive cigarettes with filters as less harmful than
   cigarettes without filters. However, scientific evidence indicates that
   cigarette filters do not reduce the risks associated with smoking. We
   examined opposition to banning the sale of cigarettes with filters,
   beliefs about whether removing filters makes cigarettes much more
   harmful, and whether this belief is associated with opposition to
   banning filters among adults who smoke cigarettes from four high-income
   countries. Aims and Methods: Data are from 2980 adults who smoke
   cigarettes and participated in the 2022 ITC Smoking and Vaping Survey in
   Australia, Canada, England, and the United States. Weighted descriptives
   estimated opposition to a cigarette filter ban and the belief that
   removing filters makes cigarettes ``much more,{''} ``a little more,{''}
   ``not more{''} harmful, or ``don't know.{''} Adjusted regression
   analyses examined the association between opposition to banning filters
   (vs. support/don't know) and the belief that removing filters would make
   cigarettes much more harmful (vs. otherwise). Results: Across all
   counties, 69.3\% opposed banning filters, 11.5\% of respondents
   supported banning filters, and 19.1\% did not know (main effect for
   country differences: p = .001). Country differences remained significant
   after adjusting for covariates (p = .047), with adults who smoke in
   Australia and the United States being significantly more likely to
   oppose a filter ban than those in England. Canada did not differ
   significantly from any of the countries. Nearly half (45.9\%) believe
   that removing filters would make cigarettes much more harmful, 28.6\%
   reported a little more harmful, 15.3\% were unsure, and 10.2\% reported
   not more harmful (country differences: p = .002). Country differences
   were no longer significant after adjustment (p = .18). Believing that
   removing filters makes cigarettes much more harmful was strongly
   associated with op-posing a filter ban (78.5\%) (vs. otherwise: 62.1\%,
   p < .001) .Conclusions: Across all four countries, three-quarters of
   adults who smoke erroneously believe that removing filters would make
   cigarettes more harmful, and believing that doing so would make
   cigarettes much more harmful was the strongest predictor of opposing a
   filter ban. Implications: More than 90\% of manufactured cigarettes
   worldwide contain filters. Contrary to marketing claims by the tobacco
   industry, cig-arette filters do not offer any health protection from
   cigarette smoke; however, three-quarters of adults who smoke erroneously
   believe that cigarettes with filters are much less harmful than
   cigarettes without filters. To protect public health and the
   environment, the World Health Organization has recommended that
   policy-makers consider banning cigarette filters as they are unnecessary

Abstract = {The Institut Pasteur has set the ambition to encourage all staff to get
   involved in sustainable development across all departments on campus.
   The animal facility staff joined the efforts of the sustainable
   development department to analyse current and future processes and
   identify potential solutions and related brakes and leverages for the
   reduction of the animal facilities' environmental impact. The first step
   was to collect the managers' experience on the local initiatives. Then,
   the managers attended a workshop to share information on networks and
   initiatives relevant to the topic and community, and to discuss the use
   of consumables, including personal protective equipment, single use
   plastics, bedding, feed, water, chemicals, and waste management. On the
   topics of interest, local initiatives were specifically detailed to
   assess their eventual implementation in all the institute's animal
   facilities, and tasks were set to pursue the managers' efforts in the
   longer term. A scenario was used to teach how to compare the carbon
   footprints of washing and disinfection equipment and process and to
   decide on the design of an animal facility. Finally, a summary is drawn
   of the brakes and leverages for the reduction of the environmental
   impact of the institute's animal facilities.

   Das Institut Pasteur hat sich zum Ziel gesetzt, alle Mitarbeiter
   anzuhalten, sich abteilungs \& uuml;bergreifend auf dem Campus f \&
   uuml;r nachhaltige Entwicklung einzusetzen. Die Mitarbeiter der
   Tierhaltungsanlagen schlossen sich den Bem \& uuml;hungen der Abteilung
   f \& uuml;r nachhaltige Entwicklung an, um aktuelle und k \& uuml;nftige
   Prozesse zu analysieren und potenzielle L \& ouml;sungen sowie damit
   verbundene Hemmnisse und Hebel zur Verringerung der Umweltauswirkungen
   in den Anlagen zu ermitteln. Der erste Schritt bestand darin, die
   Erfahrungen zu sammeln, die die Leiter mit lokalen Initiativen machten.
   Daraufhin nahmen die Leiter an einem Workshop teil, um Informationen \&
   uuml;ber Netzwerke und Initiativen auszutauschen, die f \& uuml;r das
   Thema und die Gemeinschaft relevant sind, und um die Verwendung von
   Verbrauchsmaterialien wie pers \& ouml;nliche Schutzausr \& uuml;stung,
   Einwegplastik, Einstreu, Futter, Wasser, Chemikalien und
   Abfallmanagement zu diskutieren. Zu den Themen, die von Interesse sind,
   wurden lokale Initiativen detailliert beschrieben, um ihre m \&
   ouml;gliche Umsetzung in allen Tierhaltungseinrichtungen des Instituts
   zu bewerten. Es wurden Aufgaben formuliert, um die Bem \& uuml;hungen
   der Leiter langfristig zu verfolgen. Anhand eines Szenarios wurde
   gezeigt, wie ein Vergleich des Kohlenstoff-Fu ss abdrucks von Wasch- und
   Desinfektionsanlagen und -verfahren anzustellen und wie \& uuml;ber die
   Planung einer Tieranlage zu entscheiden ist. Abschlie ss end wird eine
   Zusammenfassung der Hemmnisse und Hebel zur Verringerung der
   Umweltauswirkungen der Tieranlagen des Instituts gezogen.

   detallaron espec \& iacute;ficamente las iniciativas locales para
   evaluar su posible aplicaci \& oacute;n en todas las instalaciones para
   animales del instituto y se establecieron tareas para proseguir los
   esfuerzos de los gestores a largo plazo. Se utiliz \& oacute; un
   escenario para ense \& ntilde;ar a comparar las huellas de carbono de
   los equipos y procesos de lavado y desinfecci \& oacute;n, as \& iacute;
   como para decidir el dise \& ntilde;o de una instalaci \& oacute;n para
   animales. Finalmente, se hace un resumen de los frenos y palancas para
   la reducci \& oacute;n del impacto medioambiental de las instalaciones
   para animales del instituto.},
