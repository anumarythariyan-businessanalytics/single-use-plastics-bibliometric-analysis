Abstract = {This paper analyses the coverage and socio-contextual representation of
   the single-use plastics ban by two mainstream newspapers in Malawi, The
   Daily Times and The Nation Newspapers, between January 2019 and December
   2022. Single-use Plastics are one of the most significant environmental
   issues threatening the ecosystem and inducing climate change, with
   substantial costs to Malawi's tourism industry, agriculture, and health.
   Informed by the social representations theory and thematic analysis, the
   study established political and expert indexing that reproduced the
   views of those in power. The dominant themes from the newspapers
   included policy and court proceedings, demonstrating the heavy
   contestation of the issue. In its discursive strategies, the news media
   employed criminal and monster metaphors to portray single-use plastics
   as a villain in environmental degradation. Given this, the article
   argues that though the single-use plastic ban is a rational idea,
   apparent alternatives that resonate with the general public directly
   dependent on single-use plastics should be provided for effective
   implementation and enforcement. The article concludes that newspapers'
   threatening representation and reliance on government and experts' views
   while marginalising the public directly involved with single-plastic use
   offers no urgent and pragmatic positive solutions in the face of
   increasing plastic waste.},

Title = {Reducing Single-Use Plastic Bags to Combat Pollution: Analyzing Drivers
   and the Role of Environmental Policy Among Chinese Millennials},
Journal = {POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 APR 16},
Abstract = {Environmental pollution is a widespread issue with significant
   implications for ecological health, environmental quality, and
   biodiversity. Plastic pollution has become one of the most pressing
   environmental issues as the rapidly increasing production of disposable
   plastic products overwhelms the world's ability to deal with them.
   Moreover, plastics have become an integral part of human life, and the
   use of single-use plastic bags has increased in recent times, creating
   severe environmental pollution and global sustainability problems.
   Therefore, a reduction in single-use plastic bags is necessary to
   control environmental pollution and decrease its carbon footprint.
   Therefore, this study used partial least squares structural equation
   modeling to analyze data collected from 567 Chinese millennials to
   investigate the drivers of single-use plastic bag reduction to improve
   environmental quality in China. Moreover, the study also analyzed the
   moderating role of environmental policy perception between environmental
   concerns and single-use plastic bag use reduction to assist policymakers
   in improving environmental quality. The results showed that
   environmental knowledge, carbon footprint reduction awareness, and
   environmental concerns significantly affected the single-use plastic
   reduction attitudes of citizens. The results also indicated that
   environmental policy promotion assists in decreasing plastic pollution
   by decreasing the use of single-use plastic bags. A pro-environmental
   attitude was also found to positively affect single-use plastic bags.
   Therefore, environmental policies and awareness about the carbon
   footprints of individual actions should be created to control plastic
   pollution and improve environmental quality globally.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigated plastic waste management on Sichang
   Island, Thailand, with a focus on single-use plastic waste and polymer
   composition analysis. A total of seven single-use plastic categories are
   referenced in this papers according to Thailand's Plan for Plastic Waste
   Management Phase II (2023-2027) that attempts to reduce plastic waste in
   landfills, increase recycling, and decrease plastic waste entering the
   ocean. Plastic waste (49.17\%) is the dominate solid waste material on
   Sichang Island. The results of our investigated demonstrated that
   74.47\% of the waste consisted of single-use plastics, and the top three
   dominant single-use plastic-types were plastic bags, single-layer
   plastic film packaging, and plastic bottles. The identified polymer
   types (i.e., LDPE: 31\%; PET: 20.5\%; and HDPE: 18.5\%) were consistent
   with those commonly found in single-use plastics. This study assessed
   three single-use plastic management scenarios for Sichang Island using
   lifecycle assessment (LCA) with seven impact categories. The results of
   the LCA demonstrated that scenario S3 under the Sichang model, which
   includes refuse-derived fuel (75\%) and recycling (25\%), was the most
   environmentally friendly. In addition, the findings of this study
   indicate that sustainable management should separate waste at the source
   and promote the utilization of environmentally friendly materials.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastics (SUPs) are having catastrophic effects on marine
   environments. Establishing effective reduction and circularity
   strategies is complex and necessitates a legal approach that fosters
   reflexivity and learning by regulated companies, especially those that
   produce and sell SUPs. Reflexive environmental law (REL) offers a
   promising starting point to identify drivers and techniques in law that
   foster reflexivity, yet fails to consider how to define and identify
   reflexive responses by regulatees. Using reflexive governance and social
   learning literature, this article identifies four responses: negative,
   single-loop adaptive, double-loop reflexive and triple-loop reflexive.
   The article uses an explorative case study of the EU's Single-Use
   Plastics Directive (SUPD), and its transposition by France and Germany,
   to analyse how the SUPD fosters company reflexivity through techniques
   building autonomy, accountability and responsiveness and adjustability.
   Through, among others, interviews with companies that must comply with
   the SUPD, this article reveals that single-loop and double-loop
   responses are the most prominent. However, reflexivity is shown to be
   inhibited by institutional, organisational and market factors. Better
   understanding of the dynamics between reflexive drivers within law(s)
   and the institutional, organisational and market characteristics of
   regulated actors is needed to design more effective regulations to
   transform to a sustainable circular plastics economy.},

Title = {Environmental and economic impact assessment of single-use laboratory
   plastic waste: A case study},
Journal = {CLEANER WASTE SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Research labs rely on disposable plastics for sterility, safety, and
   affordability, but their environmental and economic impact has been
   largely overlooked. While the impact of single-use plastics is
   well-known, laboratory waste poses an additional challenge due to
   necessary treatment processes. Hence, this study investigated both the
   environmental and economic impact associated with single-use plastic
   waste management in a university laboratory, serving as a case study for
   Southeast Asia. A retrospective analysis was conducted on laboratory
   plastic waste management between 2014 and 2023 at a Malaysian
   university. Three waste management methods, i.e. incineration,
   landfilling with microwave pre-treatment, and landfilling with ozone
   pre-treatment, were implemented at consecutive intervals. Environmental
   impact was assessed by quantifying the GHG emissions in terms of carbon
   dioxide equivalent (CO(2)eq) emissions, while economic assessment was
   evaluated based on invoiced costs. A total of 29,180.11 kg of single-use
   plastic waste resulted in 46,420.08 kg CO(2)eq emissions and a
   cumulative disposal cost of RM 84,890.49. Among the three methods,
   landfilling with ozone pre-treatment demonstrated the lowest
   environmental impact (1.55 kg CO(2)eq/kg) and cost (RM 2.79/kg). Direct
   emission from the end-of-life stage was the main source of GHG
   emissions, while disposal fees represented the largest portion of total
   costs. In light of these findings, it is crucial for universities and
   research institutions to recognise the environmental and economic impact
   of laboratory single-use plastics. This case study will serve as a
   foundation for advancing pre-treatment technologies and future
   end-of-life solutions.},

Journal = {CLEANER WASTE SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Single-use plastic foodware production continues to rise despite the
   negative impacts it has on the environment. This continued growth is
   fueled by the increasing popularity of single-use plastic foodware for
   food service. Although previous studies have found reusable foodware to
   be a more environmentally, and economically, favorable alternative, the
   capital required to establish and maintain a reusable foodware system
   remains a common barrier to its implementation. This study aims to
   address this problem by assessing the environmental and economic
   viability of a proposed third-party company, equipped with an industrial
   dishwasher and commercial truck that could pick up and deliver reusable
   foodware to participating food service providers. The results of the
   Life Cycle Analysis revealed that the reusable foodware must be reused
   at least 25 times within the proposed system before having less
   environmental impacts in every category. The economic analysis concluded
   that the reusable foodware system could generate an annual profit while
   also saving participating food providers upwards of \$0.07 per place
   setting. Ultimately, the third-party reusable foodware system could be
   an environmentally and economically favorable alternative to single-use
   plastic foodware.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM INSIGHTS},

Abstract = {PurposeThe main purpose of this study is to explore factors and develop
   a plastic-reducing behavior model (PRBM) for predicting single-use
   plastic (SUP)-reduction behaviors among coastal tourists in Jordan and
   in Bangladesh by extending theory of planned behavior
   (TPB).Design/methodology/approachBased on literature review and focus
   group discussions (FGD) with the experts' opinions and suggestions, the
   possible factors are identified. Subsequently, a structured interview
   schedule is prepared and 503 usable data were collected that is used for
   further analysis by partial least squares-structural equation modeling
   (PLS-SEM), using Smart PLS3.3.3.FindingsThe results of this study have
   revealed that SUPs reduction intention significantly affects SUPs
   reduction behavior. Further, the study findings have identified that
   disposability concern, environmentalism norms and eco-consciousness have
   significant impacts on SUPs reduction intention among coastal tourists
   in Jordan and in Bangladesh.Practical implicationsThe study findings can
   be a guide for policymakers and industry operators to formulate
   strategies that can enhance coastal tourists' concerns about plastics
   disposal, environment and ecology for reducing overall SUPs from coastal
   tourism destinations in Jordan and in Bangladesh.Originality/valueThis
   is the first empirical study that explores factors and develops a unique
   research model by integrating disposability concern, environmentalism
   norms, eco-consciousness and SUPs reduction intention to explain SUPs
   reduction behaviors among coastal tourists in Jordan and in Bangladesh.},

Title = {Unveiling the hidden chronic health risks of nano-and microplastics in
   single-use plastic water bottles: A review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {495},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {Single-use plastic products, such as water bottles, have become
   ubiquitous in modern society, contributing significantly to the growing
   problem of plastic waste in landfills, rivers, oceans, and natural
   habitats. This poses severe threats to biodiversity and ecosystem
   stability. The emergence of microplastics (1 mu m to 5 mm) and
   nanoplastics (less than 1 mu m) has raised alarms about their harmful
   effects on human health. Nanoplastics are especially hazardous due to
   their smaller size and enhanced ability to infiltrate the human body.
   There are critical gaps in the literature regarding the contamination of
   nano-and microplastics from single-use plastic water bottles,
   emphasizing the urgent need for further research. Here we review, we
   examine the global impact of nano-and microplastics from single-use
   plastic water bottles on human health, drawing insights from over 141
   scientific articles. Key findings include the annual ingestion of
   39,000-52,000 microplastic particles by individuals, with bottled water
   consumers ingesting up to 90,000 more particles than tap water
   consumers. The literature reveals variations in the number of nano-and
   microplastics particles, their sizes, and a lack of information on their
   physical properties. Moreover, the review highlights the chronic health
   issues linked to exposure to nano-and microplastics, including
   respiratory diseases, reproductive issues, neurotoxicity, and
   carcinogenicity. We highlight the challenges of standardized testing
   methods and the need for comprehensive regulations targeting nano-and
   microplastics in water bottles. This review article underscores the
   pressing need for expanding research, increasing public awareness, and
   implementing robust regulatory measures to address the adverse effects
   of nano-and microplastics from single-use plastic water bottles.},

Abstract = {The increase in reliance on online meal delivery services and take-outs
   due to changes in consumer behavior has resulted in an escalation in the
   consumption and disposal of single-use plastics. With the mounting
   apprehension over the ecological consequences of the increased plastic
   waste, finding effective solutions is a crucial concern. This study aims
   to determine the priority of criterion for reducing plastic waste in the
   foodservice sector using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP)
   method. An onsite survey via questionnaire was conducted to gather
   responses from 16 key players who were involved directly and indirectly
   in plastic waste mitigation initiatives. The findings revealed that the
   key players prioritize the criteria related to harmonizing environmental
   impact, whereas public acceptance was assessed as being of lower
   priority. This article offers practical insights into single-use
   plastics in foodservice, using real data and perspectives from experts
   in the field to build on existing research.},

Title = {Balancing the ban: Navigating the economic and environmental trade-offs
   of single-use plastics in Ghana},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {388},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {As bans on single-use plastics gain momentum as a policy tool to combat
   plastic pollution, debates continue among scholars and policymakers
   regarding their environmental efficacy and economic consequences. This
   paper empirically examines the socio-economic and environmental
   trade-offs of a potential single-use plastic ban in Ghana, guided by the
   central research question: What are the key considerations and
   implications of such a policy? Employing a mixed-methods approach, the
   study draws on quantitative and qualitative data from plastic
   manufacturers, retailers and households across Accra, Kumasi,
   Sekondi-Takoradi, and Tamale. The findings reveal a stark divide in
   stakeholder perspectives: while households overwhelmingly support the
   ban, citing perceived environmental, aesthetic, and public health
   benefits, manufacturers and retailers oppose it, pointing to the absence
   of viable alternatives, weak regulatory enforcement, a thriving black
   market, and the economic significance of the plastic industry. A ban
   could lead to significant economic disruptions, including an estimated
   GHC3.5 million (\$648,148) in weekly labour income losses, translating
   to over GHC14.4 million (\$2.6 million) monthly, and an estimated GHC5.4
   million (\$1 million) in weekly tax revenue losses. These disruptions
   risk undermining export volumes, foreign exchange earnings, and overall
   economic stability by decreasing the production and export of
   plastic-related products while increasing dependence on more expensive
   imported alternatives, ultimately straining Ghana's trade balance and
   fiscal space. Rather than an outright ban, the paper recommends a
   multi-pronged, cross-sectoral policy approach that prioritizes circular
   economy principles, incentivizes sustainable business innovation, and
   fosters community-driven voluntary initiatives that promote
   environmental stewardship. This balanced strategy offers a more
   economically viable and environmentally sustainable pathway for managing
   single-use plastics in Ghana.},

Abstract = {The widespread use of single-use plastic tableware (SUPT) poses
   environmental and health risks, highlighting the need for effective
   interventions to reduce consumption and mitigate plastic pollution. This
   study examines interventions to raise awareness of SUPT health and
   environmental impacts using a theoretical mathematical model informed by
   behavioral insights from a US survey and grounded in the theory of
   planned behavior (TPB). Consumer decision-making was simulated within
   four distinct theoretical social network structures (7,000 individuals
   each) under different intervention scenarios to evaluate their impact.
   An evolutionary process tracked behavioral changes over time within the
   social network. The findings highlight the crucial role of
   awareness-raising interventions in reducing SUPT consumption, with
   health-focused interventions being the most effective. However, their
   impact varies by network structure, shaping how awareness spreads and
   influences behavior. These results underscore the need for tailored
   strategies to maximize, support policy and plan to reduce plastic
   pollution and promote sustainable consumption.},

Title = {Exploring the sustainability of single use plastics in the
   biopharmaceuticals sector: a scoping review of challenges,
   opportunities, and impacts},

Abstract = {Single-use plastics (SUPs) are synonymous with the biopharmaceuticals
   sector, facilitating economies of scale, process efficiency, flexibility
   and sterility assurance, all with a seemingly negligible environmental
   footprint. Yet, in ever-tightening regulation, mandated by the
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and by concern for large-scale
   industrial impacts, the sustainability of SUP consumption is
   increasingly being questioned. Whilst the sector contributes to human
   welfare, its transition risk is unlikely to remain immune to societal
   pressure for more sustainable production. This article aims to present a
   scoping review of the apparent contradiction between sectoral SUP
   adoption and the increasing importance of circularity. The approach to
   the review relies on three interwoven strands of evidence: {[}i] the
   intersectionality of sustainability policy and regulation with
   biopharmaceuticals, {[}ii] single-use technology in biopharmaceuticals
   and its impacts, and {[}iii] applications of circular economy principles
   to single-use technology. It is argued that, whilst life-cycle analysis
   (LCA) of SUPs in biopharmaceuticals articulates an environmental benefit
   vis-\& agrave;-vis conventional technology, high energy intensity and
   embodied carbon in stainless steel renders the comparison redundant.
   Moreover, there is a dearth of evidence on circularity, post-use, and on
   end-of-life considerations. Likewise, there appears to be little
   sector-wide appetite for the adoption of embryonic solutions for
   enhancing circularity, such as biodegradables, carbon offsets,
   reusability, waste-to-energy, and ocean cleanup. Urgent mission-driven
   research is required on LCA, circular business model feasibility,
   materials innovation, regulatory frameworks, and sectoral-wide impact. A
   design-driven inquisition of their interactions, based on industrial
   symbiosis, could inform potential adoption pathways.},

Abstract = {This study explores the influence of adaptive management indicators on
   consumer willingness to adapt to the single-use plastic (SUP) ban in
   Java Island, Indonesia, where the policy has been initiated but not yet
   fully implemented across all locations. Employing an Exploratory Factor
   Analysis (EFA) and logistic regression models, the research examines the
   impact of environmental responsibility, social and legislative
   influences, enforcement and compliance mechanisms, material preferences,
   personal guilt, and income levels on sustainable behavior. The findings
   highlight significant factors driving consumer adaptation, revealing the
   importance of enhancing environmental education, robust enforcement,
   social influence, and accessible eco-friendly alternatives.
   Environmental responsibility and satisfaction, external influences, and
   personal guilt were strong predictors of willingness to adapt, while
   income level was also a significant determinant. This study provides
   valuable insights for policymakers to design targeted strategies that
   foster public support and compliance with environmental policies,
   emphasizing the need for multifaceted approaches to promote
   sustainability and reduce plastic waste.},

Journal = {DISASTER MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {Objectives Plastics in the environment have moved from an ``eye-sore{''}
   to a public health threat. Hospitals are one of the biggest users of
   single-use plastics, and there is growing literature looking at not only
   plastics in the environment but health care's overall contribution to
   its growth.Methods This study was a retrospective review at a 411-bed
   level II trauma hospital over 47 months pre and post the last wave of
   COVID-19 affecting this hospital. Deidentified data were gathered: daily
   census in the emergency department, hospital census, and corresponding
   number of admitted COVID-19 patients. Additionally, for the same time
   frame, personal protective equipment (PPE) supply purchases and gross
   tonnage of nonhazardous refuse were obtained.Results There was a large
   increase in PPE purchased without a significant change in gross tonnage
   of weight of trash.Conclusions PPE is incredibly important to protect
   health care workers. However, single-use plastic is not sustainable for
   the environment or public health. Understanding the full effect of the
   pandemic on hospital waste production is critically important as health
   care institutions focus on strategies to decrease their carbon footprint
   and increase positive impacts on public health and the environment.},

Title = {Influential factors shaping Vietnamese students' intentions to reduce
   the use of single-use plastics},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE FUTURES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {10},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Environmental degradation due to the overwhelming of plastic waste has
   raised concerns at an alarming rate worldwide. To ensure a sustainable
   future and fulfill the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with
   particular emphasis on plastic waste and pollution (SDG 11, 12, and 14),
   understanding the factors that affecting university students' beliefs
   and perspectives towards pro-environmental behaviour are crucial,
   assisting relevant stakeholders to develop effective environmental
   initiatives that drive behavioural change. This research seeks to
   uncover the main factors driving students' intention to reduce the use
   of single-use plastics (SUPs) in Danang City, Vietnam, by utilizing the
   extended theory of reasoned action as a theoretical framework. The
   results analyzed from 429 valid data show that environmental attitude,
   subjective norm and legal and regulatory measures have significant
   impacts on the intention to reduce the use of SUPs among higher
   education students, with legislative factor having the strongest weight.
   The findings also reveals that significant differences are shown in
   gender and study background (educational level and pedagogical training
   status) towards SUPs reduction intention. These findings offer new
   insights and comprehensive information for not only policy-makers in
   assessing environmental interventions and designing effective programs
   tailored to specific group needs but also for academics in conducting
   studies focused on plastic reduction behaviour.},

Abstract = {This review presents the first comparative analysis of functional
   chemical additives in various types of single-use plastics (SUPs). These
   plastics, commonly used in industries like packaging, food service, and
   healthcare, contain additives such as stabilizers, colorants, flame
   retardants, and plasticizers to enhance their flexibility, durability,
   and appearance. However, many of these additives are not chemically
   bonded to the polymer matrix and can leach out during the plastic's life
   cycle, posing risks to human health and the environment. The review
   explores the functional characteristics, mechanisms, and benefits of
   these additives, and highlights recent advances in bio-based and
   additive-free alternatives. The study also uses the AGREEMIP tool to
   assess the greenness of the synthesis processes for various SUP
   products, ranking them in the order of environmental safety: disposable
   plastic containers for hedgehogs > disposable plastic dances >
   disposable glasses and plates > drinking straws and sticks > plastic
   bags.},

Abstract = {The growing environmental concern in the traditional single-use plastic
   in medical products has led to a search for sustainability alternatives.
   Plant derivatives are highly promising due to their abundant
   availability, renewable nature, and biodegradability, making them an
   excellent potential for a more sustainable future. This research
   investigates the involvement of plants in creating single-use plastic,
   specifically focusing on the preparation manufacturing, and processing
   of raw materials derived from plants. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes
   the latest cutting-edge research in developing and utilizing plant
   derivatives in various medical single-use product applications. The
   paper also addressed the economic and environmental benefits of
   utilizing plant derivatives over traditional synthetic materials,
   emphasizing the reduction and replacement of the current plastic
   contents. The significance of this study lies in its contribution to the
   advancement of sustainability practices in the medical industry by
   incorporating plant derivatives of single-use materials. The findings
   show that plant derivatives have a significant potential and opportunity
   as a primary raw resource, serving as an alternative to traditional
   synthetic materials. This aligns with the worldwide efforts to shift the
   landscape of the economy towards sustainable practices.},

Abstract = {Environmental taxation is often lauded as an effective tool for changing
   consumer behavior, but it can also trigger substantial psychological
   resistance, especially among disproportionately affected groups, such as
   the Jewish ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) community, potentially creating a
   broad anti-environmental backlash. In the current study we provide novel
   empirical evidence for the psychological mechanisms that can drive such
   reactance and its potential long-term persistence. In 2021, Israel
   introduced a tax on single-use plastics, only to swiftly retract it
   amidst vehement political opposition and a change in government. We
   conducted six rounds of surveys within the Haredi population, known for
   its heavy use of single-use plastics. Immediately after the tax's
   enactment, we found a substantial decrease in ``pro-climate{''}
   positions. Regression analysis showed this change to be primarily driven
   by a sense of victimization-being unfairly singled out by the tax for
   political, rather than environmental, reasons. The economic burden of
   the tax played a lesser role. Two years after the tax was repealed,
   however, the decrease in ``pro-climate{''} positions persisted, despite
   a decrease in sense of victimhood. These findings shed light on the
   potential negative and enduring psychological and political consequences
   of environmental taxation. They underscore the importance of addressing
   underlying grievances to foster genuine engagement with climate-related
   issues.},

   reusable cups for beverages},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Single-use plastic (SUP) products are widely used due to their
   convenience and low cost, with SUP cups being particularly prevalent in
   coffee shops and fast-food restaurants. This study estimates SUP cup
   consumption and evaluates their environmental impacts, focusing on
   global warming, through a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA).
   Five scenarios (S1-S5) were set and compared with conventional SUP cups.
   Results indicate that 5.8 billion SUP cups were consumed in coffee shops
   and fast-food restaurants in South Korea in 2022, equating to 113 cups
   per person annually. The global warming potential (GWP) for the baseline
   scenario (S1) was 8.12 kgCO2eq per functional unit, with SUP polymer
   production being the largest contributor. Scenario 5 (S5), involving a
   25\% substitution with reusable plastic cups and tumblers, achieved a
   20\% GWP reduction compared to S1. However, increased raw material use,
   energy demands, and cleaning processes for reusable cups led to higher
   burdens on land use and mineral extraction. It was found that reuse rate
   of reusable cups significantly influenced the results. This study
   highlights the effectiveness of deposit return scheme (DRS) and reusable
   cup policies, providing essential data to guide regulatory measures that
   mitigate SUP cup impacts and promote sustainable alternatives.},

Abstract = {Integration of extended theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and norm
   activation model (NAM) was applied to examine psychological mechanism of
   single-use plastic reduction intention (SUPRI) of citizens in Danang
   city, Vietnam. The partial least squares structural equation modelling
   algorithms were applied to assess measurement model, structural model,
   explanatory power, and predictive power of model. Personal norm,
   attitude, subjective norm, perceived behaviour control, and policy
   intervention had significant influence on SUPRI. Attitude was the most
   important factor affecting SUPRI. Regarding integrated model, awareness
   of consequence and ascription of responsibility were positively
   associated with attitude toward SUPRI while subjective norm had
   significant relationship toward personal norm. Association of policy
   intervention toward SUPRI was confirmed through direct and indirect
   relationships. Integration of TPB and NAM was effective in explaining
   SUPRI. Planning and strategy for single-use plastic reduction should be
   designed to comprehensively cover human self-interests, take advantage
   of social moral values, and promote policy enactment and enforcement
   with prioritisation of action on raising citizens' attitude toward
   single-use plastic reduction. Utilisation of geographic information
   system and remote sensing was effective in supporting random sampling.
   This study offered practical and scientific base for planners and
   policymakers in combating environmental issues from plastic waste.},

Title = {Motivating consumers to collaborate in reducing single-use plastic
   bottle pollution using an extended social identity model of collective
   action},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOCIAL MARKETING},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 NOV 13},
Abstract = {PurposeThe ever-increasing production of single-use disposable plastics
   represents a serious environmental concern, increasing both interest in
   and the need for reusable products. This study aims to empirically
   investigate the drivers of collective action intentions in reducing
   single-use plastic bottle pollution by extending the social identity
   model of collective action (SIMCA) and providing insights to enhance
   social marketing campaign strategies aimed at encouraging sustainable
   behaviour change at a collective level.Design/methodology/approachUsing
   a sample of 430 respondents from the UK, this study evaluates three
   original predictors from SIMCA, i.e. perceived anger, social identity
   and group efficacy, alongside two new antecedents: temptation to
   freeride and perceived size of collective action impact.FindingsThe
   empirical findings reveal that all three original SIMCA predictors
   positively influence collective action intentions. Among the added
   predictors, temptation to freeride significantly and negatively impacts
   collective action intentions, while the perceived size of collective
   action impact does not have a direct effect. Notably, the perceived size
   of collective action impact, temptation to freeride and group efficacy
   indirectly influence intentions via anger, highlighting anger's
   important role as a mediator.Originality/valueThe findings expand the
   authors' understanding of the factors influencing collective action
   intentions in preventing single-use plastic bottle pollution and suggest
   new SIMCA connections. These insights help refine social marketing
   messages for collective action by emphasising the pro-environmental
   impact of the entire nation, specifically for using the reusable water
   bottles.},

Title = {Sustainability impacts for converting to Raman spectroscopy inline
   monitoring from traditional offline manual sampling in small-scale and
   large-scale biomanufacturing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY},

Month = {2025 OCT 15},
Abstract = {As biomanufacturing evolves to meet environmental goals, adopting
   innovative analytical technologies creates new pathways for sustainable
   process control. This study examines the impact of replacing traditional
   offline manual sampling with inline Raman spectroscopy for monitoring
   critical bioprocess parameters in both small- and large-scale
   production. Conventional offline methods for measuring glucose, lactate,
   viable cell density and osmolality rely heavily on single-use plastics
   and frequent manual handling, leading to increased waste and carbon
   emissions. Quantitative analysis shows that integrating inline Raman
   spectroscopy with predictive modeling can eliminate about 13.36 kg of
   single-use plastic and prevent 80.17 kg of CO2 emissions per combined
   run, with potential for greater annual impact. Raman-enabled process
   analytical technology enables robust, real-time monitoring, with model
   performance metrics (R 2 and Q 2) consistently above 0.79 for key
   indicators, while also reducing contamination risk by maintaining closed
   systems. Although product quality and shipping emissions are not covered
   in this assessment, these results highlight considerable sustainability,
   operational and analytical advantages of Raman-based monitoring.
   Implementing inline Raman spectroscopy advances AstraZeneca's and the
   industry's carbon neutrality and waste reduction goals, making it a
   transformative step for responsible bioprocessing. (c) 2025 AstraZeneca,

Title = {Is reusable beverage packaging better than single-use plastic?},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE FUTURES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {10},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We assessed the environmental impacts of seven beverage packaging
   types-reusable glass bottles, reusable PET bottles, reusable PP cups,
   and single-use PET bottles and cups (with and without recycled
   content)-in the European context. We identified key emission drivers,
   including recycling rates, recycled content, electricity carbon
   intensity, reuse cycles, and transport distances. Our findings show that
   reusable systems, particularly PP cups, yield the lowest impacts on the
   environment. In contrast, single-use PET options, especially those
   without recycled content, generate the highest emissions, though
   incorporating recycled materials significantly mitigates these impacts.
   Using Monte Carlo simulation with +/- 15 \% variability in return rates,
   we confirmed that reuse systems maintain environmental superiority
   despite behavioral uncertainty. These results highlight an urgent need
   to invest in reuse infrastructure, which remains underdeveloped despite
   growing global attention, including at recent forums such as the Busan
   reuse summit.},

Title = {Reducing single-use plastics (SUPs) consumption: A synthesis of I and S
   level approaches},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE FUTURES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {10},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Single-use plastics (SUPs) pose significant global environmental
   challenges, emphasising the need for more effective intervention
   strategies. Existing reduction efforts often prioritise policy,
   legislative actions, or psychological interventions, but lack
   comprehensive guidance for future applications. This review categorises
   behaviour change interventions for SUPs reduction into individual-level
   (I-level) and system-level (S-level) approaches with three objectives:
   (1) synthesising current interventions into I-level and S-level
   categories, (2) examining their application across contexts, and (3)
   evaluating their impact on behavioural determinants. Quality was
   rigorously assessed using the `Quality Appraisal for Diverse Studies'
   (QuADS) tool. From an initial search of over 900 peer-reviewed articles
   and additional searches, 41 studies met the criteria for inclusion. The
   findings indicated that I-level interventions, mostly educational
   campaigns, yield mixed outcomes with limited evidence of sustained
   behaviour change. Conversely, S-level interventions, mostly bans and
   market-based mechanisms (e.g., fees and levies), demonstrated higher
   efficacy, particularly when strongly enforced. Notably, none of the
   reviewed studies combined I-level and S-level approaches. Analysis using
   the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model revealed
   that I-level interventions often enhanced `capa-bility' but overlooked
   `opportunity', while S-level interventions created `opportunity' but
   generally neglected `capability'. Both types of interventions are
   insufficiently targeted at `motivation'. This review underscores the
   urgent need for multi-faceted approaches that integrate both I-level and
   S-level strategies and engage stakeholders to bolster intervention
   effectiveness.},

Abstract = {In recent years, there has been substantial growth in e-commerce
   services. Regarding food retail services, several requirements and
   peculiarities for product preservation during transport cause excessive
   consumption of single-use plastics, which can be harmful to the
   environment. The aim of this study is to contribute to sustainable
   solutions for supermarket e-commerce services, replacing single-use
   plastics with reusable equipment with high longevity. Mixed methods were
   applied for this study including a participant observation of a
   real-operations context test of the proposed solution in the store of
   Continente in Aveiro, where the picking and expedition processes were
   evaluated with extensive data collection. The solution comprises a set
   of components designed to adapt to the equipment currently used in
   Continente, as well as many other supermarkets worldwide. It is expected
   that this solution will contribute to a significant reduction in single
   use packaging materials, such as plastic bags and protective,
   spill-resistant plastic packaging. In addition, the designed components
   improve product protection during transport, ensuring their physical
   integrity. The results of a real-operations test, coupled with the
   collaboration of designers, engineers and experienced operation
   employees of Continente Online, substantiate this proposal as a viable
   solution, providing important improvements to the service.},

Title = {Bureaucratic politics in customized implementation of the EU Single-Use
   Plastics Directive in France and Germany},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUN 30},
Abstract = {When implementing EU policies, national policy bureaucracies often face
   a goal conflict when national policy preferences are not aligned with
   the EU policy and they are granted little discretion in implementation:
   While customized implementation allows them to adjust EU policies to the
   national context, it also risks noncompliance with EU law and blame for
   unpopular EU policies. This bureaucratic politics perspective has
   received little attention in institutionalist and interest-based
   explanations of customized implementation. With a bureaucratic politics
   approach, this article argues that national governments pursue
   strategies of blame avoidance and reputation seeking when confronted
   with high goal conflict between timely and correct implementation and
   substantive (national) policy goals. This argument is illustrated in a
   comparative case study on the implementation of the EU Single-Use
   Plastics Directive in France and Germany. This article identifies
   bureaucratic strategies of blame avoidance and reputation seeking as an
   underlying mechanism of customized implementation.},

Title = {Plastic Detectives Are Watching Us: Citizen Science Towards Alternative
   Single-Use-Plastic-Related Behaviour},
Journal = {RECYCLING},
Year = {2025},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The alarming increase in single-use plastic (SUP) consumption,
   exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and its detrimental effects on
   environmental and public health, underscores the urgent need for the
   public to adopt more environmentally responsible behaviours. This study
   presents citizen science (CS) initiatives undertaken two years after the
   onset of the pandemic as an effective means to engage and mobilise
   citizens in reducing plastic consumption. It combines an inventory of CS
   actions targeting SUP with a self-designed and implemented CS project.
   Unlike the predominantly technical focus of existing initiatives, our
   `Plastic Detective' project was designed to collect behavioural data
   related to SUP use. The majority of completed and ongoing CS projects
   addressing SUPs focused on beach clean-ups, which primarily involved
   reporting the distribution and composition of plastic litter. However,
   no initiatives were found to address consumer behaviour. CS activities
   were predominantly initiated in a bottom-up manner, largely coordinated
   by non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and were mostly confined to
   the Northern Hemisphere. In our project, volunteers were asked to
   observe, sample and categorise behaviours in their surroundings using a
   model that distinguished between SUP use and the adoption of alternative
   materials or practices. Additionally, participants' perceptions of SUP
   were assessed through pre- and post-surveys. Our findings reveal that
   young people, in particular, are eager to participate in CS initiatives.
   Regardless of age, gender or location, all respondents-despite
   acknowledging the need to reduce SUP consumption-identified producers as
   the key group responsible for addressing plastic pollution. We conclude
   that CS can act as an effective knowledge broker between research and
   non-research communities, fostering behavioural change towards more
   sustainable practices. Moreover, CS initiatives can play a vital role in
   popularising scientific findings and influencing policy-making processes
   to promote environmentally friendly alternatives to SUPs.},

Title = {Rethinking single-use plastics: Innovations, polices, consumer awareness
   and market shaping biodegradable solutions in the packaging industry},
Journal = {TRENDS IN FOOD SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},

Abstract = {Background: The production of single-use plastics (SUP) is increasing
   and has become one of the most pressing environmental problems. Scope
   and approach: This review evaluates the environmental aspects of SUP in
   the packaging industry, considering challenges, impacts and global
   policies. The focus is on biodegradable packaging alternatives,
   certification standards, consumer behavior, and the critical role of
   R\&D and patents in moving towards a circular economy. This report
   integrates discussions on bans and taxes on SUP globally and proposes
   comprehensive strategies, including extended producer responsibility and
   consumer education. The technological status and trends in biodegradable
   plastics are addressed. The impact of certification standards and
   patents are examined. Consumer demand for eco-friendly packaging is
   explored, highlighting the complexity of purchasing behavior influenced
   by demographic and economic factors as well as marketing strategies. The
   phenomenon of green- washing and the importance of transparent
   environmental labeling are also addressed. Key findings and conclusions:
   Global efforts to curb SUP have led to a 68\% reduction in polyethylene
   bags in some regions. Legislative action against SUP is essential,
   especially for packaging, which accounts for 53\% of SUP. Biodegradable
   plastics currently account for 0.5\% of the 400 million tons of plastics
   produced annually. 44\% of patents filed worldwide for biodegradable
   polymers relate to packaging. Their growth depends on strict standards,
   transparent certifications and the priority of environmental integrity
   over the market. The growing demand for biodegradable packaging based on
   sugar cane, cassava and corn starch reflects consumer awareness. Real
   progress is hampered by the mismatch between consumer intentions and
   behavior, economic constraints and greenwashing. A solid legal
   framework, eco-labels and environmental education are essential.},

Title = {An environmentally friendly solution against waste: upcycling single-use
   plastic waste and biomass for antibiotic remediation},

Abstract = {The increasing use of single-use plastics and antibiotics in healthcare
   systems has exacerbated environmental issues, posing risks to both
   public health and ecosystems. The surge in medical waste, particularly
   during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlights the urgent need for sustainable
   waste management solutions. This study presents the development of a
   novel carbon-based adsorbent material derived from polyethylene
   terephthalate plastic waste and agricultural biomass, aimed at
   mitigating antibiotic pollution, specifically ciprofloxacin (CPX), in
   aqueous environments. Comprehensive validation of the adsorbent was
   performed through various analytical techniques, exploring key
   operational parameters such as contact time, pH, and dosage to optimize
   adsorption efficiency. Results show a significant improvement in surface
   area, reaching 349.89 m2/g at 500 degrees C, with CPX removal efficiency
   reaching 93\%. Importantly, the inclusion of polyethylene terephthalate
   in the composite significantly increased the number of active sites,
   leading to enhanced interaction with ionizable CPX molecules and
   superior sorption efficiency. Moreover, incorporation of lignin from
   biomass in the co-pyrolysis process enhances the material's thermal
   stability and promotes polymer depolymerization, further increasing
   adsorption performance. These findings demonstrate the potential of the
   composite adsorbent in reducing medical and plastic waste while
   contributing to sustainability and net-zero targets in healthcare
   systems. Further research is recommended to assess the material's
   long-term effectiveness in real wastewater applications.},

   and Strategies for Sustainable Polyolefin Replacement},
Journal = {MOLECULES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {30},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {The widespread use of single-use plastics, particularly polyethylene
   (PE) and polypropylene (PP), has resulted in severe environmental
   pollution due to their durability and resistance to degradation. This
   report reviews current degradable alternatives to conventional
   polyolefins and strategies for enhancing their breakdown in natural and
   managed environments. Mechanisms of abiotic and biotic degradation are
   examined alongside the influence of environmental factors and
   standardized testing protocols. Commercially available biodegradable
   polymers-such as polylactic acid (PLA), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs),
   poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate)
   (PBAT), starch-based plastics, cellulose derivatives, chitosan, and
   protein-based materials-are evaluated for their sources, degradation
   behavior, applications, scalability, and limitations. In addition,
   modification techniques for PE and PP, including copolymerization,
   pro-degradant additives, blending with biodegradable fillers, surface
   functionalization, enzyme-assisted degradation, and photocatalytic
   additives, are critically assessed for their potential to reduce
   environmental persistence. Key challenges such as performance
   trade-offs, incomplete degradation, ecotoxicity, cost, scalability, and
   end-of-life management are discussed within the context of circular
   economic integration. This report concludes with future research
   directions aimed at developing cost-effective, high-performance
   materials that degrade completely under real-world conditions while
   minimizing ecological impacts.},

Title = {Barriers to successful implementation of plastics management policies in
   Africa: a case study of South Africa's plastic pollution management
   challenges},
Journal = {INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 AUG 5},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution is a critical environmental threat with far-reaching
   impacts on ecosystems, biodiversity, and human health, and has recently
   been recognized as part of the broader planetary crisis. While global
   efforts have advanced policies addressing plastics across their
   lifecycle, South Africa has made notable progress in domestic policy
   development, particularly through its ratification of international
   conventions targeting marine and transboundary plastic pollution.
   Despite this progress, significant challenges persist in translating
   policy into action. Domestically, although regulatory mechanisms
   exist-including those targeting single-use plastics and extended
   producer responsibility (EPR) schemes-implementation gaps remain. A key
   barrier is the lack of widespread environmental education and public
   awareness campaigns, which limits citizen engagement and behavioral
   change. Additionally, fragmented municipal waste systems and the
   exclusion of informal waste pickers from formal waste governance
   structures further exacerbate the issue. These systemic challenges
   result in persistent plastic accumulation in natural environments and
   the continued degradation of vulnerable ecosystems. The current article
   recommends that any policy enforcement or green initiative be supported
   by coordinated national environmental awareness campaigns. Furthermore,
   informal waste pickers-who contribute significantly to plastic
   recovery-must be formally integrated into EPR schemes, as outlined in
   existing regulatory provisions. While policies targeting plastic bags
   are in place, enforcement is limited, and single-use plastics continue
   to pose significant challenges. To strengthen plastic waste governance,
   South Africa should consider a phased ban on problematic single-use
   plastics, coupled with the promotion of affordable, sustainable
   alternatives. Compared to other developing countries, South Africa has
   made commendable policy advances; however, a greater investment in
   citizen-focused implementation strategies is required. Without such
   action, well-crafted policies risk remaining ineffectual and failing to
   produce meaningful environmental outcomes.
   Key points South Africa has a comprehensive regulatory framework for
   plastic management.National Environmental Management: Waste Act (NEM:
   WA) (2008) focuses on downstream waste, leaving a major regulatory gap
   in the plastic production and consumption.Extended producer
   responsibility (EPR) provisions require stringent enforcement and
   oversight.Informal waste pickers need to be integrated into the current
   EPR schemes and the formal waste management sector to address the
   current challenges of plastics waste mismanagement.},

Abstract = {The environmental and health impacts from single-use packaging plastics
   (SUPPs) constitute a critical hurdle for a sustainable future.
   Environmentally less impactful substitutes are being developed by
   circular business models (CBMs), such as reusable and SUPP-replacing
   products. To get rooted within a system, i.e., achieving customer
   acceptance and alignment with regulatory and market contexts, CBMs need
   to undergo transition stages. The present study investigates these
   transitions, in particular, the hereto underlying mechanisms of learning
   and solution-trialling. Based on questionnaire-guided interviews with 11
   circular enterprises in Hong Kong, the investigation classifies applied
   learning and solution-trialling mechanisms. It then assesses if
   companies exhibit similarities in the practice of mechanisms and whether
   these influence the firms' circular business strategies over time. The
   findings show that circular firms featuring significant correlations in
   the use of solution-trialling and learning mechanisms also exhibit a
   notable alignment in their circular business strategies.},

Title = {Driving voluntary reduction of single-use plastic consumption:
   Capability, opportunity, and motivation},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE FUTURES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {10},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The excessive use of single-use plastic (SUP), especially SUP tableware,
   has caused a global plastic waste crisis. Understanding the factors that
   drive consumers to reduce SUP tableware usage is essential for
   addressing this issue. Current studies often use simplistic models that
   fail to capture the complexity of human behavior in reducing SUP,
   indicating a need for more comprehensive approaches. Grounded in the
   robust COM-B model and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), this
   study aims to understand the factors influencing individuals' behavior
   to reduce SUP tableware. These frameworks offer a solid basis for our
   research, viewing complex SUP consumption behavior as an interplay of
   capability (psychological and physical), opportunity (social and
   environmental support), motivation (people's thinking and feeling), and
   outcome behavior. Two online surveys were administered to 354 (Study 1)
   and 644 (Study 2) Chinese participants. Results showed that capability
   and opportunity are associated with SUP tableware reduction behavior,
   fully mediated by motivation. The model explains 70 \% of motivation in
   SUP tableware reduction. Motivation predicts approximately 48 \% of
   actual SUP tableware reduction behavior. Capability, opportunity, and
   motivation are higher-order constructs measured by lower-order
   constructs. Capability is predicted by action control, action planning,
   action skills, decision-making, and habits. Behavioral Opportunity is
   associated with social norms, social support, and environment.
   Motivation is affected by identity, reinforcement, goals, and
   self-efficacy. Finally, theoretical and practical contributions
   inspiring more consumers to protect our environment were discussed.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastic bottled water (SUPBW) is a major contributor to
   microplastic pollution. This study aimed to investigate factors
   influencing university students' consumption of SUPBW. This
   cross-sectional survey, conducted during the 2023-2024 academic year at
   the country's largest public university, used a self-administered online
   questionnaire and convenience sampling. The questionnaire was developed
   based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Knowledge,
   Attitude, and Practices (KAP) frameworks. It included sections on
   general information, knowledge of environmental and health impacts, TPB
   constructs, and consumption behavior. Descriptive and regression
   analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with SUPBW
   (SUPBW) consumption. The study included 438 participants. Factors that
   were significantly associated with frequent SUPBW consumption included
   undergraduate enrolment (OR = 2.33, p-value = 0.02); higher household
   income (OR = 1.64, p-value = 0.02); lack of environmental literacy from
   courses (OR = 1.87, p-value < 0.01), initiatives (OR = 1.22, p-value =
   0.021), and workshops (OR = 1.51, p-value < 0.01); peer pressure (OR =
   3.86, p-value < 0.001); subjective norms from family and friends (OR =
   1.91, p < 0.01); perceived behavioral control (OR = 2.68, p-value =
   0.01); convenience (OR = 1.32, p-value = 0.015); and strong intentions
   to continue use (OR = 2.45, p-value < 0.001). In contrast, higher
   knowledge of environmental impacts and health impacts were associated
   with infrequent SUPBW consumption. In conclusion, to reduce SUPBW use,
   interventions should enhance environmental literacy, counter social
   pressures, and offer sustainable options.},

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},

Abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) have become ubiquitous
   worldwide, posing complex challenges for marine organisms, ecosystems,
   and human health. In Costa Rica alone, approximately 4000 tons of solid
   waste are generated daily, of which about 11 \% is plastic. Nearly 600
   million single-use plastic bottles are produced yearly, with similar to
   90 \% not being collected. Consequently, reports of MPs in beaches,
   crustaceans, fishes, and bivalves are increasing on the Pacific and
   Caribbean coasts. Evidence suggests these plastic fragments can induce
   oxidative stress and inflammation in organisms, affect fundamental
   physiological processes (e.g., feeding, reproduction), and may even
   cross the blood-brain barrier. Recent policies in Costa Rica, including
   Law N degrees 9786 (single-use plastics) and a proposed ban on MPs in
   cosmetics (Bill No. 23,694), mark progress. However, enforcement
   challenges remain-particularly given the country's limited wastewater
   treatment coverage. This review discusses key sources of MPs (e.g.,
   wastewater, synthetic fibers, tire wear), current sampling and
   characterization protocols, and ecotoxicological consequences for marine
   life and humans. We further analyze existing legislation, highlighting
   gaps and prospective solutions, and propose an integrated approach
   involving technological upgrades, biodegradable polymers, and microbial
   degradation strategies to mitigate plastic pollution.},

Abstract = {Water popularly termed the `The Elixir of Life' is now polluted beyond
   control in several regions. Microplastics, the tiny contaminants have
   found their way into all walks of life. They have also been found to be
   present in human blood, multiple organs, and even breast milk. There is
   an abundance of microplastics in the air we breathe, the food we eat,
   and the water we drink. Curbing them has to start with a ban of all
   forms of primary microplastics, and single use plastics with preference
   being given to biodegradable alternatives. India in particular banned
   single use plastics in 2022, which put an end to several commonly used
   plastic items being replaced with biodegradables. Paint is one of the
   largest contributors to microplastics, followed by textile industry,
   cosmetic, pharmaceutical industry, packaging industry are all top
   contributors to microplastics. The wastewater treatment plants aren't
   designed to filter microplastics from the source and this results in
   microplastics polluting all water resources. Though several novel

Abstract = {Between 2005 and 2014, per capita plastic usage increased by
   approximately 25\% worldwide whereas in Bangladesh, it increased by
   16.2\%. A 2019 survey found that annually, Bangladeshis disposed of
   87,000 tons of single-use plastics, approximately 96\% of which
   originates from food and personal care products packaging. Additionally,
   during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the widespread usage of mostly
   non-biodegradable single-use plastics in personal protective equipment
   resulted in their accumulation in landfills and the surrounding
   environment. In addition, in recent years, climate-induced flooding
   events in the country exacerbated macro- and microplastic pollution
   stemming from the mismanaged plastic waste from relief supplies
   packaging materials. Moreover, projected rainfall scenario for 2040 and
   2060 under RCP 4.5 scenario suggest exacerbated risks of flooding, which
   will likely impact plastic pollution. Through a combination of a
   systematic literature review and field, the present study assesses the
   plastic waste management strategies used in Bangladesh, identifies
   research gaps and offers insight into plastic recycling in the nation,
   with a particular emphasis on Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh. The
   findings indicate that integrating plastic recycling systems within a
   circular economy is anticipated to lower greenhouse gas emissions and
   environmental pollution while promoting several UN Sustainable
   Development Goals.},

Abstract = {The high environmental impact caused by the accumulation of single-use
   plastic calls for measures to curb this problem, from a ban on
   single-use plastic tableware to the production of a wide range of
   biodegradable and reusable products. The aim of this study was to
   investigate how tableware made of different materials affects consumers'
   sensory perception and emotional and hedonic responses when eating the
   same meal. In this study, four types of meals of animal or plant origin
   were selected for the experiments, which were served warm or cold.
   Accordingly, four groups of university students were instructed to taste
   the corresponding meal while using three sets of tableware made of
   different materials: polypropylene, wood/cardboard, and a stainless
   steel/ceramic/glass control set (regular set). Overall, the results
   suggest that the use of regular tableware elicited a positive emotional
   profile, while the use of disposable, wooden, and plastic tableware
   elicited negative emotional responses, which is consistent with the
   acceptability of the meal samples-regular tableware received higher
   ratings, while both types of disposable tableware received lower
   ratings. Finally, the material of the tableware only led to changes in
   odor and flavor perception when warm-served meals were sampled-higher
   intensities were reported when students used the regular tableware sets.
   Wooden cutlery imparted an atypical woody flavor to the meals,
   regardless of the type of meal.},

Title = {Environmental and Economic Impacts of Substituting Single-Use Plastic
   Straws: A Life-Cycle Assessment for Greece},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},
Number = {9},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {The usage of more than 30 billion straws a year has been reported in the
   European Union (EU), in 2020, one year before the official ban of
   single-use plastics in Europe. The impacts of this plastic waste on the
   environment and on our health are global and can be drastic. Since then,
   various alternative straws have emerged. This study assesses their
   effectiveness, primarily from an environmental perspective, to determine
   the best option among those available. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) was
   conducted using ReCiPe 2016 methodology and ISO 14040/44 standards,
   alongside a preliminary cost analysis and a consumer preference survey.
   The findings reveal that wheat straws demonstrated the lowest overall
   environmental impact, with a climate change contribution of only 0.0568
   kg CO2 eq. per year, while plastic straws showed the lowest cost at EUR
   0.30 per year but contributed 0.084 kg CO2 eq. Metallic straws, despite
   being reusable, had the highest washing-related emissions, with 85\% of
   their annual impact (similar to 0.169 kg CO2 eq.) attributed to
   dishwashing. Paper and bioplastic alternatives showed up to 2.5 times
   higher climate impacts than plastic. Cost-wise, bamboo straws reached
   EUR 7.97/year, while silicone and metal straws were more economically
   favorable at EUR 1.17 and EUR 2.81, respectively. The consumer survey
   highlighted that 85\% of users preferred traditional plastic straws, but
   76\% were open to reusable alternatives. From a socio-economic point of
   view, cost seems to play a minor role. However, consumers' preferences
   towards the new products and their awareness of health and environmental
   risks are very significant factors affecting their approval of new
   alternatives and their displeasure towards traditional straw
   elimination.},

Title = {Plastic Pollution and Framework Towards Sustainable Plastic Waste
   Management in Nigeria: Case Study},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution and its environmental consequence are on the rise
   globally. In Nigeria, the proliferation of plastic bottle and sachet
   water (PBSW) manufacturing companies in various parts of the country has
   led to an increase in plastic waste generation. Existing studies have
   identified challenges and the critical need for the adoption of
   sustainable solutions to mitigate its adverse environmental impact,
   especially for developing countries. Therefore, the motivation for this
   study stems from the urgent need for a progressive shift in the studies
   focused on feasible solutions to the common challenges and strategies
   for implementation. This study aims to investigate the identified
   challenges of a lack of awareness and waste management of single-use
   plastics in Nigeria, towards achieving a circular economy of plastic
   waste whilst considering its socio-economic context. This study used a
   mixed method approach combining quantitative and qualitative data
   through interviews and questionnaires to investigate awareness on the
   impact of plastic pollution amongst key stakeholders in plastic waste
   management in the UNN. The potential of introducing a DRS in the
   sustainable collection of single-use plastic bottle and sachet water
   waste was also explored. The result reveals the perceived consequence of
   plastic pollution is short-term, at the level of mesoplastics,
   physically observed as plastic litter (68.2\%), leading to a blockage of
   canals (65.0\%), an excessive rate of flooding (19.1\%) and other
   related issues; effective channels of creating awareness and educating
   the public on plastic pollution are social media (48.3\%), school
   education (23.3\%), mass media (21.7\%), and others (6\%). An
   implementation framework for sustainable plastic waste collection was
   developed from the research findings, adapting the Norwegian Deposit
   Return Scheme (DRS) to suit the current socio-economic context of the
   population. Additionally, awareness can be increased through targeted
   government policies that reward sustainable plastic waste management
   practices, public awareness campaigns, and the use of social media.},

Abstract = {The increasing environmental impact of single-use plastics necessitates
   the exploration of sustainable alternatives. This study investigates the
   use of watermelon rind (Citrullus lanatus) as a raw material for
   producing bioplastic films. By utilizing the epicarp and mesocarp of

   characterizations, including optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results
   reveal the potential of watermelon rind to produce biodegradable films,
   demonstrating thermal stability and structural characteristics that
   could position these bioplastics as viable substitutes for conventional
   plastics. This research not only offers a solution to plastic waste but
   also adds value to agro-industrial waste.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastics (SUPs) are deeply embedded in everyday consumption
   in rapidly developing Asian cities, yet their widespread use contributes
   to marine debris, microplastic pollution, and health risks. This study
   aimed to inform evidence-based policymaking to mitigate marine plastic
   pollution in the ASEAN+3 region. Stratified random sampling surveys (n =
   1492) were conducted both face to face and online across five
   representative cities between September 2022 and February 2023. We
   quantified and compared the consumption and disposal patterns across
   nine SUP categories, assessed demographic influences, evaluated the
   impact of COVID-19, and derived insights for targeted policy
   interventions. Non-parametric tests were used to evaluate the
   differences. The results reveal significant inter-city variation:
   Shanghai and Harbin reported high overall SUP use despite a lower
   consumption of plastic shopping bags; Hanoi and Depok showed lower
   overall use but distinct preferences for plastic shopping bags and party
   cups; and Phnom Penh had the highest consumption of plastic shopping
   bags, bottles, and straws. Plastic shopping bags were the most used item
   in all cities (18-34 bags per week), with no significant differences
   between urban and rural areas, ages, or genders. In contrast, urban
   residents reported a higher use of plastic takeout containers, cutlery,
   coffee cups, and party cups. The COVID-19 pandemic notably reshaped SUP
   consumption patterns. Additionally, over half of SUPs were disposed of
   without proper separation. These findings underscore the need for
   flexible, phased, and context-specific interventions to support a
   resilient circular economy.},

Abstract = {Large-scale public events can significantly influence coastal pollution,
   particularly through short-term increases of microplastics (MPs). This
   study assessed temporal and spatial variations in MP concentrations
   (fragments, fibers, and pellets) at Flamengo Beach, Rio de Janeiro,
   before, during, and after Carnival, with an additional control sampling
   eight months later. Results revealed sharp increases in all categories
   during Carnival, followed by stable post-event levels and subsequent
   reductions in the control period. Fragments constituted the dominant
   category (66.3 \%), followed by fibers (26.2 \%) and pellets (7.5 \%).
   Within the fragment group, visually recognizable items, such as glitter,
   which is intensively used during Carnival festivities, were notable. No
   significant spatial variation was detected between mesolittoral and
   supralittoral zones, suggesting that intense human activities uniformly
   affect these areas. By linking mass recreational events with
   spatiotemporal patterns of MP accumulation, this study provides novel
   evidence of how urban festivities act as acute drivers of microplastic
   contamination in sandy beaches. These findings underscore the need for
   improved beach management practices and effective measures to mitigate
   single-use plastic pollutants and non-essential items, with glitter
   serving as a notable example due to its widespread use, high visibility,
   and increasing recognition in regulatory frameworks. These insights
   underscore the need to integrate pollution mitigation into sustainable
   event planning and coastal governance.},

Title = {The theory of reasoned goal pursuit: An empirical test in the domain of
   avoiding single-use plastic packaging},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {106},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Research on the role of goals in shaping pro-environmental behavior
   remains relatively underdeveloped. By integrating active procurement
   goals and approval goals into the theory of planned behavior (TPB), the
   theory of reasoned goal pursuit (TRGP), proposed by Ajzen and Kruglanski
   (2019), offers a comprehensive framework for conceptualizing the social
   cognition processes that mediate the effect of goals on behavior. The
   TRGP highlights the importance of goals by positing not only direct
   effects of goals on behavioral and normative beliefs, but also their
   moderating influence on the relationship between these beliefs and the
   constructs of attitude and subjective norm. Furthermore, the TRGP
   introduces motivation as a key mediating variable in the relationship
   between attitude, subjective norm, and behavioral intention, with the
   effect of attitude and subjective norm on motivation also expected to be
   moderated by activated goals. This paper presents the methodology and
   results of a pilot study (N = 49) aimed at identifying active
   procurement and approval goals, followed by a main study (N = 402)
   testing key assumptions of the TRGP in the context of avoiding
   purchasing products packaged in single-use plastic. Structural equation
   modelling was employed to assess the model, which accounted for 59 \% of
   the variance in attitude, 44 \% in subjective norm, 51 \% in perceived
   behavioral control, 69 \% in motivation, 83 \% in intention, and 14 \%
   in behavior. The results confirm most of the main effects postulated by
   the TRGP, though no empirical support was found for the proposed
   moderating effects of activated goals. The article concludes with a
   discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of the TRGP and
   offers recommendations for enhancing its empirical implications through
   improved methodological approaches.},

Title = {Assessment of consumer perspectives on the use of paper packaging in
   Trinidad},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {20},
Number = {5},
Abstract = {Background Paper packaging is increasingly being used to replace single
   use plastics to mitigate the negative effects of plastic pollution on
   the environment. While many developed countries have made considerable
   strides in this transition, developing countries, like Trinidad, have
   lagged behind, partly, due to no stringent legislation for types of
   packaging at commercial outlets.Objectives The objectives of this study
   were to investigate the demand for and assess public perceptions of
   sustainable paper packaging in Trinidad.Methodology Data were collected
   using a Knowledge, Attitudes, Practices (KAP) survey supplemented by
   interviews, packaging stress testing, and analysis via SPSS.Results A
   majority of participants demonstrated awareness of recycling knowledge
   (79\%) and deforestation awareness (84\%); which aligns with the 71\% of
   participants who considered themselves environmentally conscious. The
   attitudes and practices of participants did not correlate directly with
   their environmentally conscious behaviour such as willingness to
   purchase paper-based food containers (67\%), finding paper packaging
   more aesthetically pleasing than plastic (73\%) and willingness to pay
   more for paper packaging (53\%). The interviews highlighted a demand for
   sustainable paper packaging while also identifying challenges such as
   waterlogging of packaging, sustainable raw materials sourcing, packaging
   strength, and the need for customer testing and feedback. The stress
   test showed good appearance and durability.Conclusions Overall, the
   sustainable paper packaging stress test received favourable feedback and
   there were varying levels of knowledge, attitudes and practices related
   to sustainable packaging. Future research can build on the current
   findings and the questionnaire can be replicated after the introduction
   of replacement of single use plastics with non-wood paper packaging.},

Abstract = {Plastic waste pollution poses a critical challenge for environmental
   sustainability and socioeconomic well-being and is a severe
   environmental problem that has a significant impact not only on the
   natural ecosystem but also on socio-economic issues. To solve problems
   related to plastic waste pollution, we must clearly understand the
   current situation and related issues arising from plastic pollution in
   the research area. In this study, plastic input and leakage were
   examined during pre- and post-monsoon periods in the coastal regions of
   Can Gio District. Fifty-seven transects with differing ambient
   population densities in the study area were investigated for litter
   leakage, along with evaluations of single-use plastic consumer goods at
   the point of sale. The results showed that population density and pre-
   and post-monsoon periods did not affect litter densities. The CEI values
   representing 75\% of the study area were classified as ``clean,{''} and
   the litter density values representing 75\% of the survey area were
   below 0.16 items/100 m. Most single-use plastic consumer items are
   produced domestically, facilitating the implementation of extended
   producer responsibility regulations.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to explore value and behavioral habit changes in
   relation to responsible consumption of single-use plastics in
   college-aged students enrolled in a course related to sustainability. A
   secondary aim is providing an example of a pedagogical approach at the
   classroom level in which students themselves are study
   subjects.Design/methodology/approachA sample of 24 undergraduates from a
   midsized university in Washington, DC, participated in a two-week
   experiential education opportunity where they replaced their plastic
   straw use with a metal straw. A mixed-methods approach combined pre-post
   and delayed-post surveys with qualitative data from participant journals
   to understand participant experience.FindingsIn total, 80\% of
   participants reported increased awareness of plastic straws and their
   own use of them, and many participants described new or renewed efforts
   to avoid straws and other single-use plastics and products when
   consuming food and beverages.Research limitations/implicationsThe sample
   size was relatively small, with no control group, and the experiment's
   duration was short. In addition, the study relies on self-reported data
   from students who may have felt pressure to respond positively to the
   effect of the study.Originality/valueThis study shows how a minor
   behavioral intervention can lead to increased sustainability awareness
   for both participants and those with whom they discuss the product
   replacement intervention. Participants reported over 60 conversations
   about sustainability with friends and family during the study.},

Abstract = {Plastic pollution in waterways poses a significant global challenge,
   largely stemming from land-based sources and subsequently transported by
   rivers to marine environments. With a substantial percentage of marine
   plastic waste originating from land-based sources, comprehending the
   trajectory and temporal experience of single-use plastic bottles assumes
   paramount importance. This project designed, developed, and released a
   plastic pollution tracking device, coinciding with Vietnam's annual
   Plastic Awareness Month. By mapping the plastic tracker's journey
   through the Saigon River, this study generated high-fidelity data for
   comprehensive analysis and bolstered public awareness through regular
   updates on the Re-Think Plastics Vietnam website. The device, equipped
   with technologies such as drone flight controller, open-source software,
   embedded computing, and cellular networking effectively captured GPS
   position, track, and localized conditions experienced by the plastic
   bottle tracker on its journey. This amalgamation of data contributes to
   the understanding of plastic pollution behaviors and serves as a data
   set for future initiatives aimed at plastic prevention in the
   ecologically sensitive Mekong Delta. By illuminating the transportation
   of single-use plastic bottles in the riparian waterways of Ho Chi Minh
   City and beyond, this study plays a role in collective efforts to
   understand plastic pollution and preserve aquatic ecosystems. By
   deploying a GPS-enabled plastic tracker, this study provides novel,
   high-resolution empirical data on plastic transport in urban tidal
   systems. These findings contribute to improving waste interception
   strategies and informing environmental policies aimed at reducing
   plastic accumulation in critical retention zones.},

Title = {Quantifying environmental impacts of cell banking through life cycle
   assessment},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 APR 7},
Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to address a gap in literature by conducting a
   life cycle assessment of a cell banking process. Cell banking plays a
   vital role across diverse fields such as regenerative medicine,
   biopharmaceuticals, and food production, yet its environmental impacts
   remain largely unexplored. Using primary data from industry, combined
   with literature, this research provides an analysis of the energy and
   resource demands of cell banking, contributing to sustainability in
   biotechnology and other related industries.MethodsThis research utilizes
   the life cycle assessment methodology to quantify the environmental
   impacts of a cell banking process. A comprehensive life cycle inventory
   was developed using primary data collected from industry experts
   involved in cell banking operations, as well as literature and
   commercial sellers. The analysis covers the entire process, including
   cell collection, preparation, cryopreservation, and long-term storage.
   Energy consumption, resource use, and emissions are assessed at each
   stage to identify key environmental impacts. Results are then compared
   to existing LCAs of related processes, such as cultured meat production,
   to contextualize findings and propose strategies for improving
   sustainability.Results and discussionThe LCA of the cell banking process
   provided valuable insights into its environmental impacts, with
   laboratory materials-particularly single-use plastics-contributing the
   most across all impact categories. This finding aligns with prior
   studies, highlighting the substantial environmental burden of lab-scale
   processes. When contextualized within cultured meat production, cell
   banking's environmental footprint is minimal, supporting prior
   conclusions that omitted this stage. Notably, the use of renewable
   energy sources reduced climate change impacts by over 90\%, which
   underscores the importance of sustainable energy in biotechnology
   processes across sectors.Conclusions and recommendationsThis study
   provided an LCA of the cell banking process, which is an unexplored
   sector, revealing significant environmental impacts, particularly from
   laboratory disposables and energy use. Proliferation and cell isolation
   stages had the largest environmental contributions, especially in
   climate change and water use categories. Transitioning to renewable
   energy sources, such as wind power, demonstrated potential to reduce
   these impacts substantially.To reduce the environmental footprint of
   cell banking, biotechnological sectors should prioritize transitioning
   to renewable energy sources and minimizing single-use plastics. Future
   research should incorporate economic and social assessments alongside
   environmental LCAs for a more holistic evaluation. Additionally, ongoing
   advancements in cell culture technologies and waste management
   strategies should be integrated into updated LCA models to ensure more
   sustainable practices across the biotechnology industry, especially in
   emerging fields like cultured meat production.Conclusions and

Title = {A continental-scale analysis of benthic litter in marine and freshwater
   habitats of the Americas using standardized citizen science data},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2026},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This study presents a continental-scale assessment of benthic
   macro-litter pollution across marine and freshwater environments in
   North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, based on standardized
   data collected by volunteer scuba divers through a global citizen
   science initiative. Latin America and the Caribbean exhibited a
   significantly higher density of marine plastic and Single-Use Plastic
   (SUP), mainly objects for food and beverage consumption, compared to
   North America. In that region, metals were the most dominant in
   freshwater environments (42 \%), whereas plastics prevailed in marine
   habitats (44 \%). Across both, top-ten litter items accounted for more
   than 68 \% of the total litter, with fishing lines representing a major
   source of benthic debris. Notably, fishing gear accounted for about 40
   \% of total marine litter in NA. Our findings underscore the critical
   role of the fishing sector in marine litter composition and the need for
   targeted regulatory actions such as stronger regional bans on SUPs and
   the introduction of extended producer responsibility schemes (as
   promoted in the European Plastics Strategy). This study also
   demonstrates the potential of well-structured citizen science
   initiatives to provide valuable quantitative data for long-term
   monitoring and to support evidence-based policy development for coastal
   pollution mitigation.},

Abstract = {For thousands of years, humans have harvested natural materials to make
   functional textiles and objects (Hardy et al. 2020). In comparison,
   synthetic, petroleum-based materials have existed for only 170 years
   (Audemars 1855; Science Museum 2019), yet they have already caused
   incomprehensible damage to the health of natural environments. There is
   an opportunity to improve the current environmental situation through
   replacing crude oil-based plastics with bio-based materials, of which
   research and production have rapidly improved in recent years. Bio-based
   materials made from organic natural matter tend to have a much shorter
   lifespan than synthetic materials or starch-based plastics. This can be
   beneficial for applications such as single-use packaging and foodware -
   at the end of their use, the materials can be nutritious for soil and
   water. Conversely, many organic bio-based materials lack waterproofness,
   which can lead to permeability and cause},

Title = {Exploration of General Waste Management and Recycling on Passenger
   Behaviour and Beliefs in the Cruise Context},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINA TOURISM RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUL 26},
Abstract = {This study empirically explores cruise passengers' behaviors and beliefs
   regarding recycling and general waste management. Confirmatory factor
   analysis and structural equation modeling were employed, and data were
   collected from 424 cruise passengers in Hong Kong. The exploratory
   factor analysis identified three main dimensions of recycling and waste
   management. Results show that the passengers' responsibility for
   recycling is associated with the perceived convenience of recycling and
   single-use plastic. These passengers' responsibilities for recycling and
   waste management are also interrelated, and their environmental beliefs
   about waste management are associated with the perceived convenience of
   engaging in eco-friendly and recycling practices during the cruise and
   with inappropriate recycling and waste disposal habits. Meanwhile, the
   perceived convenience of single-use plastic is associated with the
   perceived convenience of recycling. Inappropriate recycling and waste
   disposal habits negatively affect these passengers' responsibilities for
   recycling and waste management and are negatively related to the
   perceived convenience of recycling and single-use plastic. The
   implications of these findings on recycling and general waste management
   in cruise operations are proposed along with some suggestions for
   general waste management and recycling.

Title = {Two years of daily monitoring of floating macro-litter at the River-Sea
   interface: Aarhus River, Denmark},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2026},
Volume = {222},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Marine litter is a global problem, with rivers acting as major pathways
   for land-based waste entering the oceans. Current estimates of riverine
   litter inputs in the EU often rely on short-term visual surveys from
   bridges or piers, which provide incomplete data and a coarse
   classification of litter types. This study presents, for the first time
   in Denmark and the wider Baltic region, high-resolution daily (24 h)
   monitoring of floating macro-litter in the Aarhus River using the
   SeaProtectorOne device that spans the entire river width. Litter was
   collected continuously over two one-year periods (2021/22 and 2024/25),
   enabling a detailed analysis of litter dynamics at the river-sea
   interface. A total of 63,035 litter pieces were collected in the first
   year and 18,725 in the second. On average across both years, plastics
   were consistently dominant, accounting for 60 \% of all items, followed
   by paper and cardboard at 23 \%. Single-use plastics (53 \%) together
   with takeaway-related paper items such as bags, food wrappers, and trays
   made up the majority of inputs. Pollution peaked during weekends,
   particularly in summer and autumn, highlighting the influence of social
   and recreational activities in the city center on litter generation. The
   results demonstrate that continuous collection provides more accurate
   estimates of riverine litter fluxes than visual surveys and allows
   detailed identification of litter types, which can inform targeted
   prevention and reduction measures at local and regional scales. The
   marked decline in litter between the two periods likely reflects the
   effects of local prevention measures and increased public awareness.},

Abstract = {The healthcare sector, while aiming to protect human health and
   wellbeing, has a significant negative impact on the climate and
   environment due to massive resource use and waste production. The
   circular economy (CE), designed to preserve resources in closed-loop
   value chains, has gained global attention yet lacks practical
   implementation. This perspective paper discusses the challenges of
   implementing CE initiatives for single-use plastics (SUPs) in hospitals,
   with a specific emphasis on practitioner involvement. With a departure
   in the scientific literature on SUPs in hospitals, which shows to
   primarily use quantitative methods, such as life cycle assessments and
   waste audits, this paper suggests using mixed methods to access the
   day-to-day reality of medical staff and their unique insights on
   healthcare practices. Lastly, we suggest integrating social elements
   into CE initiatives at the micro level (e.i. in practice), drawing
   inspiration from the wellbeing economy.},

Title = {Readiness to Reduce Plastic Waste in Food Delivery and E-Commerce in
   Bangkok, Thailand},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 OCT 31},
Abstract = {The rise of online Food delivery and E-commerce has significantly
   increased plastic waste. This study aims to examine plastic waste
   generation and explore pro-environmental behaviors of consumers in
   Bangkok. Data collection involved questionnaires and in-depth
   interviews. In 2024, plastic waste from Food delivery in Bangkok is
   projected to range from 0.3 to 4.6 million kilograms, while E-commerce
   could generate 3.7-12 million kilograms million kilograms annually.
   Consumers in the Food delivery sector generally express readiness to
   reduce plastic usage but often expect leadership from government
   agencies or stores. E-commerce readiness to reduce plastic waste is
   significantly lower due to concerns about product protection. Key
   factors influencing PEB are Subjective norms (SN), Perceived behavioral
   controls (PBC), and Behavioral intentions (BIT), which collectively
   account for 87.2\% of pro-environmental actions. To address plastic
   waste in Food delivery and E-commerce, collaborative efforts among
   government agencies, platform providers, packaging manufacturers, and
   consumers are critical.},

Abstract = {The pervasiveness of microplastics (MPs) is a critical global issue that
   impacts negatively on almost all ecosystems. This study investigated MPs
   abundance, polymer types and their ecological risks in five major
   beaches (Landmark, Tarkwa bay, Elegushi, Lighter house and Oniru) along
   the Atlantic coast of Lagos, Nigeria. Beach sand and adjacent intertidal
   sediment samples were collected at five sampling points on each beach
   and MPs were recovered from them using supersaturated solution of zinc
   chloride (ZnCl2, density 1.5 g/cm(3)). The isolated MPs were enumerated
   with a stereomicroscope and classified according to their morphological
   features (shapes and colours). Average abundance ranged from 1278 +/-
   655 to 5688 +/- 1377 MPs/kg in beach sands, and from 776 +/- 214 to 2104
   +/- 1065 MPs/kg in the intertidal sediments. Attenuated total
   reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy
   identified many single-use polymer types that resulted from food
   packaging and carrier bags, as well as non-single use ethylene vinyl
   acetate (EVA) polymer, associated with recreational facilities and
   gaming equipment used on the beaches. Ecological risk assessment
   revealed that all sampled points on each beach were ``polluted{''} with
   MPs (Pollution Load Index > 1). Risk quotient (RQ) values also indicated
   risks to organisms at 86\% of the sampling points, where abundance
   exceeded a predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) value. Hazard index
   (HI), a measure of the MPs chemical toxicity, showed that the MPs might
   pose ``high{''} to ``extremely high{''} ecological toxicity at all the
   sampled points. The HI values were influenced mostly by MPs of
   polystyrene (PS), low density polyethylene (LDPE) and EVA types. Banning
   of single-use plastics should be enforced to reduce plastic pollution of
   the beaches and lessen the risks associated with MPs occurrence.},

Abstract = {Biodegradable plastics are proven to degrade faster and are thus
   presented as more eco-friendly than traditional plastics. However,
   certain environmental concerns-such as the need for specific conditions
   to biodegrade-may contribute to microplastic pollution. Understanding
   the degradation of biodegradable plastics is essential for developing
   effective waste management strategies and mitigating their environmental
   impacts. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the
   degradation and toxicity mechanisms of biodegradable plastics, while
   identifying and emphasizing their potential fates and threats in marine
   environments. It is also important to acknowledge that the extent of
   biodegradation and the efficiency of biodegradable plastics in reducing
   environmental pollution are strongly influenced by factors such as
   microbial activity, oxygen, temperature, humidity, ultraviolet
   radiation, pH, and the physicochemical properties of the plastics. This
   review highlights the research gap in fully understanding the
   degradation mechanisms and fate of biodegradable nano- and even
   picoplastics, which is crucial for developing effective solutions to
   manage plastic waste in estuarine ecosystems.},

Title = {Plastic-Free Future: Investigating Consumer Intentions and Behavior
   Toward Plastic Waste in China},
Journal = {POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUL 21},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution can decrease the ability of ecosystems to adapt to
   climate change, directly affecting the livelihoods and social well-being
   of millions of individuals worldwide. Reducing plastic consumption is a
   priority in global action plans to reduce environmental pollution and
   combat climate change. Motivating consumers to adopt green and
   environmentally friendly lifestyles, which is required to decrease
   environmental pollution in a green economy, is challenging because it
   requires behavioral shifts. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate
   different factors, including environmental concerns, affecting Chinese
   millennials' plastic packaging consumption behavior to improve their
   environmental quality. Data collected through an online survey
   questionnaire from 876 Chinese consumers were analyzed using the partial
   least squares structural equation model. The results showed that
   environmental concerns (3 = 0.0.304, p<0.01), environmental attitude (3
   = 0.466, p<0.01), and consumer awareness (3 = 0.221, p<0.01) had a
   significant direct impact on the plastic packaging purchasing intentions
   of the individuals. Similarly, intentions (3 = 0.407, p<0.01) had a
   strong positive effect on the plastic packaging purchasing behavior of
   individuals. This shows that individuals with high environmental
   concerns, a strong attitude toward environmental sustainability, and a
   high awareness of the environmental impact of single-use plastics were
   less likely to use products with plastic packaging to reduce plastic
   pollution and improve environmental quality. Therefore, policymakers
   should create environmental awareness about the repercussions of
   individual actions among the masses to control environmental pollution
   and reduce climate implications worldwide.},

Abstract = {Plastic pollution has become a major environmental challenge globally as
   millions of tons of plastic waste are entering oceans and landfills
   every year. The production and usage of plastic has surged due to its
   low cost and easy availability. This in turn leads to widespread usage
   of single-use plastics. Plastic waste takes centuries to degrade and
   when it decomposes, it breaks down into harmful microplastics that
   pollute the air, soil and water. This pollution of microplastics
   threatens wildlife, marine life and creates health risks for human
   beings. Moreover, plastic production and its waste release significant
   amounts of greenhouse gases which further contribute to climate change.
   As plastic waste is continuously accumulating in the environment its
   long-term effects on humans, climate and ecosystem are inevitable. On
   the other hand, the increased usage of electronic devices has
   transformed daily life and has raised concerns about the energy
   consumption of these devices and the generation of e-waste due to
   disposable batteries. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have emerged
   as an innovative way to convert mechanical energy into electricity by
   utilizing frictional forces and vibrations. TENGs can be integrated into
   wearable electronics which in turn eliminates the need for frequent
   battery replacement and enhances sustainability. This study presents a
   low-cost triboelectric nanogenerator made from recycled bubble wrap and
   sketching paper (BW-TENG). BW-TENG offers an efficient and eco-friendly
   way to generate energy from common household waste materials. BW-TENG is
   capable of generating an open circuit voltage (V-oc) of 6.38 V, a short
   circuit current (I-sc) of 5.9 mu A and a maximum output power of 7.84 mu
   W respectively. BW TENG not only ensures the circularity of waste
   materials but also highlights the cost-effective manufacturing of a
   lightweight triboelectric nanogenerator.},

Abstract = {The adoption of single-use plastics for fabricating lab-on-chip devices
   used in sensors, chemical and biomedical processes is escalating into a
   major environmental issue. To address the global need for developing
   long-term sustainable solutions, we present wood microfluidics as an
   alternative for electrochemical sensing. The lab-on-wood-chip (LOWC)
   device developed in this study demonstrated (i) versatility in
   electrochemical applications (electropolymerization and corrosion
   analysis), (ii) stability under highly acidic (pH 0.5), basic (pH 14.0)
   and varied temperature (4 degrees-60 degrees C) conditions (iii)
   long-term consistency in performance (>12 months), and (iv) potential
   for on-field nitrate sensing towards environmental monitoring - in a
   cost-effective, simple and sustainable manner.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastics (SUPs) are used widely in cancer research
   laboratories. They are cheap, durable, and lightweight, and until now
   have been considered disposable items. This, however, contributes
   significantly to unsustainable waste production. SUP waste is typically
   diverted to landfill or incineration, which contributes to greenhouse
   gas emissions, taking many years to degrade. Lack of robust SUP waste
   disposal streams, particularly in cancer research labs has long term
   effects on the environment. Having identified that a single laboratory
   researcher in our group generates at least 15 kg SUP tissue culture
   waste alone each year, we explore some of the issues associated with
   SUPs in pre-clinical oncology research, discussing potential reuse
   routes, alternative materials for labware and developing circular
   approaches to plastic consumption to address the green agenda. We also
   propose recommendations for improving sustainability in cancer research
   labs.},

Abstract = {Chemical depolymerization to monomer is a valuable tool in the quest to
   prevent the accumulation of single-use plastic, especially poly(ethylene
   terephthalate), PET, in the environment. However, the protic
   nucleophiles and high temperatures usually required in this process make
   the development of rationally designed, stable catalysts very
   challenging. Herein, we report a series of heterobimetallic catalysts,
   combining Zn(II) and Mg(II) with K(I) and Na(I) to form ``ate{''}
   complexes that are stable in air and at high temperatures, which can be
   applied in the depolymerization of PET and poly(lactide), PLA. The
   catalysts present outstanding stability and remain active after 4
   successive PET additions over several days on the bench. Reaction
   studies reveal the influence of the metal coordinated in the inner
   pocket of the ligand upon the activity of the metal coordinated in the
   outer pocket, with different heterobimetallic catalysts being found to
   be optimal for the depolymerization of PET and PLA respectively. Their
   potential for application in industrially relevant bulk polymerization
   of rac-lactide is also demonstrated and provides key insights for
   rational heterometallic catalyst design in the (de)polymerization of PET
   and PLA.},

Title = {River flow regime and proximity as drivers of beach marine litter
   accumulation: A case study from the Neretva River Delta, Eastern
   Adriatic},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {220},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Rivers are major transporters of land-based litter to coastal
   environments, yet the extent to which river flow and distance from the
   river mouth shape beach litter accumulation remains insufficiently
   understood. The Neretva River, the largest river system in the eastern
   Adriatic, and Mali Ston Bay, a semi-enclosed coastal area into which it
   flows, were used as a case study to investigate the influence of
   seasonal river discharge and spatial proximity to the river mouth on
   beach litter dynamics. Monthly surveys conducted over two years
   (2021-2022) at beaches located near and far from the river mouth
   quantified litter abundance, weight, and composition in relation to
   seasonal hydrological conditions. Increased river discharge during the
   wet season led to a significant rise in beach litter loads, with both
   abundance and weight more than doubling compared to the dry season.
   Proximity to the river mouth also played a key role in debris
   distribution, with higher litter loads at deltaic beaches than those
   farther away in the bay. Plastics dominated the litter composition
   across all sites and seasons, with single-use plastics particularly
   prevalent. Despite pronounced seasonal and spatial variability,
   interannual litter accumulation remained stable, suggesting persistent
   pollution sources. These findings emphasize the importance of upstream
   waste management, riverine litter interception, and seasonally targeted
   beach cleanups, particularly near river mouths, as well as the need for
   regulatory actions, such as restrictions on single-use plastics, and
   longterm monitoring to mitigate river-driven coastal litter pollution.},

Abstract = {Alternatives to conventional plastics are crucial to mitigate
   environmental pollution, fossil fuel dependence, and the potential risks
   of microplastics. Single-use packaging, the largest contributor to the
   growth in plastic production, faces significant recycling challenges.
   These plastics often persist in the environment for decades or break
   down into harmful microplastics. In this paper, we introduce a
   recyclable material created through solid polyelectrolyte complexation
   of naturally occurring polymers with increased polyelectrolyte strength.
   The material maintains stiffness comparable to thin commercial plastics
   even after six recycling cycles, yielding on average 98\% of its mass
   postrecycling. Its natural biodegradability and salt-controlled
   recyclability support material circularity, offering a promising
   alternative to synthetic single-use plastic packaging.},

Abstract = {This article explores the design journey behind a water dispensing
   system composed of a reusable water bottle and a smart refill station
   interconnected through the Internet of Things (IoT) and Information and
   Communication Technologies (ICT). The methodology embraced Design
   Thinking and Participatory Design, seeking insights and feedback from
   the intended users throughout the Smartbottle ecosystem's development
   phases. These insights substantiated the eco-friendly product
   specifications and design requisites, culminating in a solution tailored
   to a specific community. The primary aim of this system is to gradually
   phase out the use of single-use plastic water bottles within the
   premises of Polytechnic Institute of Viana do Castelo, an institution
   catering to around 6000 students and staff members. A survey conducted
   revealed a preference for recycled plastic as the material of choice,
   while the design of the bottle took on a marine animal shape. This
   symbolic choice represents the extensive ecological impact of discarding
   conventional plastic bottles, emphasizing the global urgency to curtail
   plastic waste, pollution, and accumulation.},

Title = {Sustainability Assessment of Lake Sediment-Based Soil Blocks for
   Agricultural Seedling Media},
Journal = {RESOURCES-BASEL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {The high sedimentation rate of Rawapening Lake is both an environmental
   challenge and a potential resource. Seedlings currently rely on
   single-use plastic polybags, which contribute significantly to plastic
   waste. The use of mineral soil as a growing medium can accelerate
   natural resource depletion. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility
   and sustainability of utilizing lake sediment as an alternative seedling
   media through soil block technology. An integrated Life Cycle Assessment
   was conducted to quantify the environmental impacts, and
   Multidimensional Scaling was applied to assess sustainability across
   environmental, technological, economic, social, and institutional
   dimensions. Field data from ten seedling producers using soil blocks and
   ten using polybags were analyzed. The results showed that soil block
   media reduced Global Warming Potential by 48\% compared to polybags,
   increased phosphorus and organic matter content, and was more
   financially efficient, with an increase in productivity of 90.24\% and a
   revenue cost ratio of 24.56\%. Sustainability analysis classified the
   innovation as moderately sustainable, with the highest scores in the
   environmental and technological dimensions. Institutional support was
   identified as a limiting factor. These findings suggest that
   sediment-based soil block media are a viable, lower-impact alternative
   for seedling production, although scaling up will require policy and
   institutional support.},

Title = {Global plastic treaty collapses due to industry pressure: What can we
   learn from the tobacco control treaty},
Journal = {AMBIO},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 NOV 20},
Abstract = {Global plastic production has risen from 2 million metric tons in 1950
   to over 400 million in 2022 and is projected to triple by 2060.
   Constituents like toxic additives to pervasive microplastics pose a
   major environmental and public health crisis. Yet international action
   remains fragmented. The UN Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC)
   is drafting a global plastics treaty, but INC-5.2 (August 2025) revealed
   sharp divides. High-ambition states and civil society demand binding
   caps on virgin plastic, elimination of single-use plastics, and bans on
   hazardous additives, while oil-producing and manufacturing nations
   oppose upstream measures, prioritising recycling and waste management.
   Industry lobbyists have outnumbered many delegations, raising concerns
   of policy capture reminiscent of tobacco industry tactics before the WHO
   Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). Lessons from the FCTC,
   particularly Article 5.3 safeguarding policymaking from vested
   interests, are vital. Without binding commitments and protection from
   corporate influence, the treaty risks being ineffective.},

Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {12},

Month = {MAY 21},
Abstract = {Single-use plastics (SUPs) are indispensable in laboratory research, but
   their disposal contributes substantially to environmental pollution.
   Consequently, reusing common SUP items such as microtitre plates
   represents a promising strategy for improving laboratory sustainability.
   However, the key challenge lies in determining whether SUP reuse can be
   implemented without sacrificing data quality. To investigate this, we
   conducted a simple experiment to assess the impact of reusing microtitre
   plates on microsatellite genotyping accuracy. Plates previously used for
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fragment detection were cleaned,
   opting for an environmentally friendly approach using regular soap, and
   then reused. Our results indicate that, while reusing PCR plates
   significantly increases genotyping error rates due to residual DNA
   contamination, detection plates can potentially be reused without
   compromising data quality. Our approach offers laboratories a practical
   and sustainable option for reducing SUP waste and costs while
   maintaining research integrity.},

Abstract = {Bioplastic and polylactic acid production is expected to increase in the
   future to replace single-use traditional plastics. Here we investigated
   the effects of polylactic acid contamination in marine ecosystems by
   assessing its degradation over time in an experimental mesocosm, along
   with its impact on microbial abundance, microbiome diversity, viral
   infections, and rates of organic matter cycling. We report here that, as
   polylactic acid gradually lost its integrity, a microbial biofilm rich
   in Marinobacter sp. developed on the biopolymer, reshaping the marine
   microbiome, promoting polylactic acid-associated bacteria such as the
   Saccharospirillaceae, and in turn increasing viral activity and
   accelerating the degradation of organic matter. These effects, which
   were further amplified at the temperatures experienced during heatwaves,
   suggest that high levels of polylactic acid contamination might
   influence the functioning of coastal marine ecosystems, particularly
   during extreme temperature episodes.},

Abstract = {Plastic contamination is a universal threat that affects the flora and
   fauna in the environment. This review focuses on biodegradation of
   polyethylene (PE). PE is a widely used plastic in food packaging,
   agricultural materials (mulch films) and disposable single-use plastic
   bags owing to its durability and cost-effectiveness. Being a
   hydrophobic, recalcitrant and persistent polymer, PE contaminates air,
   soil and water. The ecotoxicity, sources, fate and transport of PE and
   detection techniques like micro-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
   (micro-FTIR) are discussed. Considering the environmental impact,
   microbial degradation of PE by bacteria, fungi, and gut microbes of
   larvae supporting sustainability has been addressed. In particular,
   potential microbial enzymes (diguanylate cyclase, laccase, latex
   clearing protein, alkane monooxygenase, and lipase) involved in PE
   disintegration were elucidated based on the reviewed mechanisms and
   pathways. These pathways include oxidative, hydrolytic and peroxidative
   steps, which assist in degradation. This review details the ecotoxicity
   of PE, microbial PE degradation and their enzymatic degradation
   mechanisms that offer key knowledge in plastic remediation for future
   insights.},

   Plastic Pollution Crisis (1980s-2020s)},

Abstract = {In the 1980s, women in Oregon, Texas, and New Jersey organized the first
   ``citizen beach cleanups,{''} directing volunteers to not simply clean
   up but collate data on the number and type of trash washing up on
   American shores. These efforts introduced the wider public to ocean
   plastic pollution, thereby instigating a ``second plastic crisis,{''}
   powerfully countering neoliberal framings of environmental
   responsibility that blamed litter on individuals. As the beach cleanup
   movement grew bigger and international under the helm of the nonprofit
   Ocean Conservancy in the 1990s and 2000s, the focus shifted from ocean-
   to land-based sources of trash. In turn, a new data-collection method
   was introduced that put the onus on individual behavior. Finally, over
   the last decade or so, a new wave of waste-reduction activism has
   challenged this framing, seeking to return the spotlight on the
   companies that sell single-use plastics and thereby instigating a
   ``third plastic crisis.{''} Illustrating the key role of data collection
   in the making of the ocean plastic pollution crisis, this article argues
   that beach cleanups have been instrumental in shaping not only how we
   view plastics but also how we assign blame for its proliferation in the
   environment.},

Title = {Knowledge, attitudes and practice of consumers towards single-use

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {20},
Number = {7},
Abstract = {Introduction Plastic pollution, particularly from single-use plastics
   (SUPs), is an increasing environmental problem, especially for coastal
   communities dependent on marine ecosystems for their livelihood, food,
   and recreation. The Korle-Gonno community in Ghana epitomizes this:
   inadequate waste management systems and heavy reliance on SUPs. This
   study aimed to explore the drivers of consumer attitudes toward SUPs to
   inform effective interventions.Methods A descriptive cross-sectional
   study was conducted among 198 residents of Korle-Gonno. The study used a
   multi-stage sampling method to select participants, targeting adults who
   had lived in the community for at least five years. Data was collected
   using a structured questionnaire that assessed socio-demographics,
   knowledge, concerns, attitudes, and practices regarding SUPs. Scores
   were categorized into low, moderate, and high levels, and data were
   analyzed using STATA 17.0. Descriptive and inferential statistics were
   analyzed, including chi-square tests and logistic regression.Results The
   study showed that 51\% of the respondents have low knowledge of SUPs and
   although they considered SUPs as one of the major contributors to
   pollution, only 10.1\% reported recycling plastics, while most relied on
   improper methods of plastic disposal. Important predictors of positive
   attitude towards the reduction of SUPs were: high levels of concern
   (aOR=2.37, 95\% CI = 1.09-5.15) and good perception of environmental
   impact (aOR=4.59, 95\% CI = 2.15-10.83). Those who had lived in the
   community for more than 20 years were likely to have positive attitudes
   (aOR=2.45, 95\% CI = 1.04-5.77).Conclusion SUP pollution in Korle-Gonno
   is fueled by a lack of knowledge, inappropriate practices, and
   inadequate infrastructure. While these are major challenges, the
   community strongly supports regulation and corporate responsibility.
   Public education, improvement of the recycling system, and promotion of
   biodegradable alternatives are critical intervention strategies to solve
   this problem sustainably.},

Abstract = {This study examines South African grocery shoppers' response to the
   practice of plastic bag free shopping using the
   stimulus-organism-behaviour model. A structured questionnaire was used
   to collect cross sectional data from 529 grocery shoppers. Structural
   equation modelling was used to conduct path analysis. Media influence
   and green advertising were found to be less effective in providing the
   stimuli necessary to encourage shoppers to embrace the concept of
   plastic bag free shopping. The results also showed that the promising
   strategy to promote plastic bag free shopping is through social norms
   when they are internalised as personal norms or assimilated in the form
   of green self-identity. The findings of this study underscore the
   importance of developing credible and informative green advertising
   messages to de-activate entrenched habits of using single-use plastic
   shopping bags. This study accentuates the importance of promoting
   normative self-regulated behaviour as a sustainable strategy for
   managing plastic shopping bag litter.},

Journal = {POLYMER JOURNAL},

Month = {2025 OCT 15},
Abstract = {Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is often used as a sustainable alternative to
   petrochemical-based single-use plastics, but its slow degradation can
   lead to waste accumulation in the environment. To address this problem,
   we modified the backbone structure of PLA by replacing some carbonyl
   oxygen atoms with sulfur atoms to impart weaker thionoester linkages.
   Thiocarbonyl L-lactide was copolymerized with lactide to synthesize
   copolymers with varying molecular weights and thionoester incorporation.
   The thermal properties and aqueous stability of the resulting copolymers
   were studied, and their selective degradation in response to specific
   stimuli was evaluated. This copolymerization approach represents a
   modular strategy for yielding degradable aliphatic polyesters that are
   potentially amenable to industrial use.},

Title = {Replacing Single-Use Plastics (SUPs) in Coastal Festivals: A Critical
   Evaluation of Bio-Based, Biodegradable and Compostable Tableware,
   Regulatory Policies and Public Awareness},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Single-use plastic (SUP) tableware is one of the top ten items found on
   beaches worldwide. Bio-based, biodegradable and compostable tableware
   have emerged as a popular alternative to replace SUPs, however, often
   used without deep consideration to disposal needs and environmental
   impact, which are key aspects to ensure litter reduction. This study
   critically evaluated the usage of six bio-based tableware materials at
   coastal festivals, examined the gaps between policy regulations and
   waste management in Germany, Lithuania, Chile and Tunisia, assessed the
   social perception, awareness and acceptance towards material
   alternatives, and investigated the materials disintegration under real
   environments: estuarine water and an industrial composting facility. Our
   policy analysis revealed that whilst the majority of policies are
   designed to phase out conventional SUPs, the available infrastructure in
   the study areas is not equipped to handle alternative materials. Our
   public survey revealed a general lack of awareness regarding
   degradability, disposal requirements and ecological footprint of the
   different materials, indicating knowledge gaps and confusion in the
   public which could result in improper disposal and littering. Finally,
   the disintegration experiments demonstrated that only tableware made of
   palm leaves, cardboard, and sugar cane bagasse fully disintegrated in
   estuarine water over 1 year, while only PLA tableware fully
   disintegrated in industrial compost within 12 days, demonstrating that
   disintegration is highly environment-specific. Our findings bring
   together important aspects that have not been analyzed in conjunction
   before and highlight research gaps that become relevant in the revision
   of the International Plastics Treaty.HighlightsDiscrepancy between
   policy goals and waste infrastructure, alternative tableware materials
   cannot be correctly treated.The public perceived polylactic acid (PLA)
   tableware to have more negative effects than non-plastic
   tableware.General misinformation in society regarding correct disposal
   of bio-based materials, likely to increase littering behavior.Bio-based
   tableware lacks clear labelling and fails to disintegrate in the
   short-term.73-84\% of respondents are willing to pay for an alternative
   material, preferring reusable options.},

Title = {Characterization and exposure assessment of indoor microplastics in
   hospital indoor settled dust: First insides from India},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {279},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) in indoor environments pose emerging health risks,
   yet healthcare facilities remain understudied. This study characterizes
   MPs in settled dust from public and private hospitals in Rajkot, India,
   assessing quantification, polymer identification, and exposure
   assessment for patients and staff. Dust samples were collected from
   high-traffic (e.g., corridors, OPDs) and controlled zones (e.g., ICUs),
   followed by organic digestion, density separation, optical microscopy
   and FTIR analysis. Results revealed mean concentrations of 65.0 +/- 20.3
   MP/g (Hospital 1) and 80.0 +/- 38.5 MP/g (Hospital 2), with fibers
   dominating (52-69 \%). Red and blue MPs were most prevalent, linked to
   synthetic textiles and medical consumables. Polymer analysis identified
   polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene (PE) as dominant,
   underscores hospitals' reliance on single-use plastics and synthetic
   textiles. Size distribution highlighted 200-500 mu m particles (27-37
   \%), though smaller MPs (<50 <mu>m) were underrepresented. Estimated
   Daily Intake (EDI) for infants reached 0.82 MPs/kg/day in high-traffic
   zones, emphasizing vulnerability. Statistical analyses (Kruskal-Wallis,
   PCA) revealed spatial homogenization but institution-specific
   accumulation patterns. This study provides the first baseline data on
   MPs in Indian hospitals, future work should employ advanced techniques
   and assess long-term health impacts.},

Abstract = {Initially, biobased polymers were replaced by synthetic plastics due to
   their superior properties. However, growing concerns about the toxicity
   of plastics have emerged following extensive global production and
   reliance on single-use plastics, which contribute to significant waste
   and microplastics (MPs). MPs, ranging from 1 mu m to 5 mm, can
   infiltrate organisms, leading to adverse health effects through
   contaminated food and beverages. In response, researchers focus on
   degrading MPs using methods like enzymatic hydrolysis and Fenton
   chemistry. This review examines the classification, sources, mechanisms,
   and toxicity of MPs, while discussing bio-inspired degradation
   techniques and exploring sustainable alternatives like bioplastics.},

Abstract = {The rapid increase in the production of single-use plastics derived from
   petroleum for food protection and storage has generated significant
   concern within both the consumer sector and the food industry, primarily
   due to associated health hazards and environmental impacts. An emerging
   and promising solution involves the development of biodegradable films
   classified as active and intelligent, formulated from biopolymers
   sourced from renewable materials and enriched with bioactive compounds
   exhibiting antimicrobial and antioxidant functions. These films function
   by directly mitigating key degradation mechanisms (such as microbial
   proliferation and oxidative reactions involving molecular oxygen) that
   compromise nutritional value, sensory quality, and the safety of food
   consumption. Furthermore, for these packaging materials to be viable,
   they must exhibit specific functional and structural performance
   characteristics, which arise from the cohesion, interactions, and
   physicochemical attributes of their constituent components. This review
   focuses on evaluating the mechanical and barrier properties of packaging
   films specifically engineered for food protection, incorporating
   bioactive compounds with demonstrated antimicrobial and antioxidant
   capabilities.},

Journal = {SURFACES AND INTERFACES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {59},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Polypropylene non-woven fabric (PNW) is widely used in hygiene products,
   medical supplies, personal protective equipment, and filters due to its
   biocompatibility, thermal stability, permeability, and affordability.
   During the COVID-19 pandemic, PNW became crucial in protecting frontline
   healthcare workers. However, its susceptibility to bacterial and viral
   contamination, coupled with its contribution to single-use plastic waste
   problems, necessitated improvement. This study introduces a sustainable
   solution by modifying PNW with {[}2-(acryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium
   chloride oligomer (OAETC), a quaternary ammonium compound, through
   azobisisobutyronitrileinitiated free radical polymerization and UV
   irradiation. OAETC was covalently bonded to PNW, imparting durable
   antiviral properties that persisted through multiple washes and extended
   storage. The modified PNW demonstrated over 99.99 \% inactivation of
   bacteriophage Emesvirus zinderi (MS2) and exhibited effective
   antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and
   Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Its biocompatibility, confirmed by
   minimal cytotoxicity in HaCaT cells, underscores its potential for safe
   application. This research offers a simple but promising strategy for
   enhancing the functionality and reusability of PNW, thereby addressing
   public health concerns and mitigating environmental impact.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Implementation of public policies sometimes results in spillover effects
   on nontargeted outcomes. When policy makers repeal these policies due to
   industry pressure and community resistance, do the spillover effects
   from the policy persist after a repeal? Specifically, the authors ask
   (1) whether these spillovers induced by policy, when present, carry on
   after a repeal (i.e., become ``carryovers{''}); (2) how these carryovers
   evolve over the short and medium term; and (3) what benefit thresholds
   the policy must meet to offset spillovers during implementation and
   carryovers after repeal. To address these questions, the authors examine
   two pro-environment policies that were later repealed: a ban on
   single-use plastic grocery bags and the imposition of a fee. They find
   that the increase in trash bag sales, which began during policy
   implementation, persisted for several months after repeal. A break-even
   analysis suggests that the net effect on plastic bag savings is likely
   positive even after repeal. Only modest reductions in grocery bag use
   would be needed to break even, suggesting a favorable outcome for the
   environment. This study alerts policy makers and firms to potential
   carryovers from policy repeals that can persist well after a repeal.},

Abstract = {Surgery is a major driver of climate change due to carbon emissions.
   Single-use materials and tools account for the largest environmental
   effects. In this Video 1, we present 12 strategies to promote
   sustainability in the gynecology operating room, with a focus on
   minimizing single-use, disposable products: 1) reduce glove changes, 2)
   custom surgical packs, 3) reusable scrub caps, 4) avoid disposable
   energy devices, 5) stainless steel manipulators, 6) reusable suction
   irrigators, 7) alternatives to specimen-retrieval bags, 8) minimize
   single-use plastic trocars, 9) avoid advanced access platforms, 10) make
   the most of every suture, 11) use a laparoscope for cystoscopy, and 12)
   minimize red bag waste. Throughout the video, we present data to support
   our recommendations. Each of these strategies represents a small step,
   but, added together, they can make a big difference in our environmental
   effect as surgeons. A toolkit with additional resources is available in
   Appendix 1, available online at http://links.lww.com/AOG/E234.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS EARTH \& ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {As the demand for single-use plastics rises, sustainable plastic
   management has become a pressing concern. Transforming plastic waste
   into value-added fuels is a promising waste-to-energy strategy that
   benefits environmental and energy security. In recent years,
   biochar-based catalysts (BBCs) have attracted increasing attention for
   their cost-effectiveness, well-developed pore structure, and effective
   surface functional groups in catalytic conversions of plastic waste into
   fuels. Many researchers have documented the successful utilization of
   biochar catalysts for efficient plastic waste valorization. However, a
   systematic review of biochar-based catalytic valorization of plastic
   waste into useful fuels is still missing. We assessed practical
   applications of biochar-based catalytic pyrolysis and advanced oxidation
   technologies, evaluating their performance from life-cycle and
   techno-economic perspectives. Machine learning was also introduced to
   design high-performance BBCs and optimize the plastic upcycling system.
   This eco-friendly innovation supports several UN SDGs and provides
   valuable insights for the UN Treaty on Plastic Pollution.},

Title = {Enzymatic degradation of PET using a novel thermophilic PETase},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY \& INNOVATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {40},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Single-use plastics, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), have
   become an overwhelming environmental issue due to their persistence and
   accumulation. The discovery of a class of biocatalysts (PETase) capable
   of breaking down PET into its monomeric components has opened new
   possibilities for sustainable PET recycling. In this study, we
   identified a novel thermophilic PETase, called Depolymerising Isolated
   Enzyme from Geothermal Origin (DIEGO), from geothermal metagenomic
   samples. DIEGO was produced in recombinant form and its ability to
   hydrolyse PET and its analogues, including bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-TPA
   (BHET) and nanoPET, as well as post-consumer PET (PcPET) food trays, was
   proved. We observed a synergistic effect of DIEGO and temperature at 60
   degrees C: the enzyme converts PET into ethylene glycol (EG),
   terephthalic acid (TPA), along with the intermediates
   mono(2-hydroxyethyl)-TPA (MHET) and BHET; while temperature promotes
   auto-hydrolysis of MHET and BHET units. Therefore, this combined effect
   allowed the complete degradation of PET in TPA and EG within four days,
   by-passing the use of an additional enzyme for the degradation of
   intermediates. These findings highlight DIEGO as a promising candidate
   for industrial-scale enzymatic PET recycling and contribute to the
   development of sustainable plastic waste management strategies.},

Abstract = {Polystyrene (PS) is a widely used single-use plastic and a major
   component of global waste. Its overaccumulation poses a critical
   environmental issue due to its non-biodegradable chemical structure,
   featuring phenyl moieties and long linear alkanes. Urgent recycling
   solutions are needed as the problem continues to worsen. In this work,
   the photodegradation of PS using (BiO)(2)CO3 nanoparticles under
   UV-light, converting it into useful products like phthalates which have
   potential applications as plasticizers. The effects of catalyst load and
   exposure time on the reaction yield are discussed in this research. The
   (BiO)(2)CO3 nanoparticle powders were obtained by atmospheric CO2
   absorption, and they were characterized using XRD, SEM, HRTEM and
   SEM-EDS. The oxidized PS was analyzed using FTIR-ATR, TGA, and DSC,
   confirming successful oxidation at room temperature. The degradation
   products were identified by FTIR, and their structures verified by NMR
   H-1, C-13. This approach offers a promising recycling solution for PS
   waste.},

Title = {Chemo-catalytic recycling of PET waste: Progress and prospects for
   circular economy and valorization},
Journal = {NEXT MATERIALS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a non-biodegradable single-use
   plastic, is emerging as a significant environmental issue. The extensive
   utilization of PET in packaging, especially for disposable products like
   beverage bottles and food containers, has led to a growing build-up of
   its waste in landfills, rivers, and oceans, contaminating the ecosystem
   and eventually infiltrating the global food chain. The limitation of
   existing physical degradation methods has spurred interest in chemical
   recycling as a promising alternative for managing PET waste.
   Traditional, non-catalytic methods for depolymerizing PET are sluggish,
   energy-intensive, and require high temperatures and/or pressures.
   However, recent breakthroughs in material chemistry have led to the
   introduction of innovative strategies that can significantly enhance PET
   degradation under relatively mild reaction conditions. This review
   highlights the most recent advances in the development of efficient
   catalysts such as biomass-waste, mixed metals, zeolites, metal-organic
   framework, nanomaterials, organocatalysts, and ionic liquids for the
   processes of glycolysis, methanolysis, and reductive depolymerization.
   Each section provided a brief overview of the catalyst preparation,
   functionality, active sites, and reaction mechanism.},

Abstract = {The European Commission's single-use plastics directive has put major
   restrictions on the use of chemically modified cellulosics for different
   material applications, e.g., as films, fibres, foams and other shaped
   objects. In addition, the wet strength and barrier properties of some of
   these materials are lacking, in comparison to petrochemical-based
   plastic materials. In the current study we demonstrate that it is
   possible to carry out surface selective acetylation of kraft fibre paper
   and nano-paper to create materials that maintain biodegradability. This
   is shown to be highly dependent on the degree of bulk acetylation, with
   those materials with modification restricted to fibril surface
   monoacetylation offering fine control over enzymatic digestibility.
   Materials which show the formation of cellulose triacetate were much
   less degradable in the timeframe of our assessment methods. However, the
   wet strength and extensibility of these materials was significantly
   improved, pushing the envelope for application towards moisture-rich
   environments. The mechanistic component of our study shows acetylation
   occurs down to the elementary fibril surface level, and not just on the
   macrofibre, or fibrillar bundle, level. We believe that this study
   offers a strong basis for widening the application scope of cellulosics
   towards traditionally petrochemical-based synthetic plastics.},

Abstract = {To address the pressing need for sustainability in healthcare and reduce
   plastic waste, this study assesses the environmental and economic
   impacts of plastic trocars in Stockholm's healthcare sector. Using life
   cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) across seven
   scenarios, the findings reveal that the Reusablerecycling scenario
   reduced environmental impacts-lowering the climate change potential (kg
   CO2-eq) by 91 \%, resource use, fossil (MJ) by 62 \%, and resource use,
   minerals, and metals (kg Sb-eq) by 64 \%-compared to the current
   Single-use incineration scenario. Additionally, the reusable system
   proved to be the most costeffective despite a higher purchase cost. This
   research contributes to the academic understanding of circular
   strategies in healthcare by providing insights into the economic and
   environmental performance of medical devices. The findings also inform
   policymakers, highlighting the need for investment in sterilization and
   recycling infrastructure to support reusable systems and advance
   sustainable healthcare practices aligned with a circular economy.},

Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2026},
Volume = {224},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Worldwide, billions of ultra-thin plastic bags for fruits and vegetables
   are used annually for convenience, contributing substantially to
   environmental pollution. To address this issue and better understand the
   drivers and barriers to adopting greener or packaging-free shopping
   behavior, this study examines real-life purchase decisions at the point
   of sale. A field experiment was conducted in four German supermarkets,
   combining structured observations of more than 3,000 fruit and vegetable
   purchases, followed by 413 quantitative interviews. Results show that
   more than half of consumers already avoid single-use plastic bags for
   bulk produce. Behavioral intentions, perceived knowledge, involvement,
   and emotional response contribute significantly to different packaging
   choices, whereas subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and
   environmental concerns have only a limited impact. This study advances
   theoretical research with empirical insights from real-world consumer
   behavior and provides practical guidance for stakeholders seeking to
   foster sustainable consumer behavior.},

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the most complex and time-sensitive crises
   humanity is facing, thereby driving a quest for more sustainable product
   alternatives across all sectors. In hygiene-critical sectors like
   medicine, the development of sustainable materials is imperative because
   of the predominant use of single use plastics. Polylactic acid (PLA) has
   emerged as a bio-based alternative for clinical applications because of
   its degradation profile. To further enhance antibacterial properties and
   sustainability performance, a novel biocomposite based on PLA with hemp
   hurd filled with silver nanoparticles (AgNP) was developed. Here we
   present a life cycle assessment (LCA) based on ISO 14040 and 14044 to
   evaluate the added value of the antibacterial biocomposite compared to
   conventional antibacterial materials from an environmental perspective.
   The environmental impacts are analyzed in comparison to virgin PLA,
   fossil-based polypropylene (PP) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE)
   combined in a disinfecting wipes and sterilized application. Our results
   show that the novel biocomposite has in general higher environmental
   impacts than its counterparts. Notably, our findings suggest a
   significant impact derived from high energy demand required for AgNP
   synthesis. To be able to compete with other materials, the energy demand
   needs to be minimized, which should be the focus of further research.},

Abstract = {Powerful business interests threaten to capture policy design. From a
   quiet politics perspective, businesses are especially influential in
   policy design under conditions of low political salience. From a
   bureaucratic politics perspective, bureaucratic power based on
   specialist expertise is also strongest in low-salience contexts and
   enables them to withstand business influence. Under what conditions does
   bureaucratic power or business power prevail in policy design under low
   political salience? This article argues that policy bureaucracies can
   restrict business power by mobilizing expertise for a different policy
   design than that advocated by business if they have a strong and
   competing organizational interest in the policy design. This argument is
   illustrated in a case study on the design of Extended Producer
   Responsibility for single-use plastics in Germany as a deviant case of
   high business influence under quiet politics. This article contributes
   to understanding business-bureaucracy interaction outside business home
   turf and below the political radar. It enhances quiet politics by
   introducing the role of bureaucratic responsiveness based on
   organizational interests and expertise.},

Abstract = {Plastic waste is one of the most pressing environmental issues, posing
   significant risks to human health and marine ecosystems. Although
   efforts to ban single-use plastics are increasing, plastic pollution
   continues to escalate. Citizen science projects have been used to
   address this challenge, inviting communities to help observe, record,
   and remove plastic from marine environments to support environmental
   solutions and influence policy. However, this research argues that these
   efforts fall short in fostering behaviour change among participants, as
   data remains primarily a resource for analysis rather than a catalyst
   for social transformation. Shifting this perspective, the study explores
   the potential of citizen-generated data to act as a medium that inspires
   change by capturing citizens' reflections, emotions, and insights on
   plastic consumption and waste. By applying the concept of meshwork to
   understand how data is interwoven in daily life, the project proposes an
   embodied approach to tracking plastic consumption through a collectively
   designed data-tracking kit and co-creation workshop. Told through a
   series of infographics and analyses, the paper proposes a new
   perspective on data as an active force in addressing complex
   environmental challenges, such as plastic waste, through citizen
   involvement and experiential learning.},

Abstract = {Emerging contaminants are a new and concerning form of pollution with
   potentially harmful effects on both the environment and human health.
   Emerging contaminants are chemical compounds found in everyday products
   such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, single-use plastics and
   pesticides. These products are widely used and can easily enter the
   environment through wastewater, surface runoff and other pathways. Even
   at low concentrations, emerging contaminants have shown to have an
   adverse effect on aquatic organisms, wildlife and human health. This
   briefing explores the sources of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFAS), microplastics and pharmaceuticals, their fate, the
   ways they enter and move through the environment, and their impacts on
   ecosystems and human health. The challenges associated with the
   detection and monitoring of these pollutants are identified and the need
   for innovative solutions to mitigate the risks posed by this new wave of
   pollution is highlighted. The steps being taken to combat these
   pollutants are discussed, along with the conversations behind the
   development of standards and regulations for PFAS, microplastics and
   pharmaceuticals.},

Abstract = {This study on sustainable nanocellulose modifications for various
   packaging applications is driven by the global social awareness and
   growing demand for bioproducts to reduce the use of single-use plastics.
   Mixed office waste (MOW) was used as the raw material to extract
   cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) via the acid hydrolysis method. The
   average length and diameter of the CNCs were approximately 104.08 +/-
   0.1 nm and 9.49 +/- 0.3 nm, respectively. The crystallinity index was
   87\%, as confirmed using transmission electron microscopy and X-ray
   diffraction analysis. Coating solutions of varying concentrations were
   prepared by mixing CNCs with collagen hydrolysate and glycerin, and the
   coatings were applied to the surface of uncoated paper via a rod coating
   process. FTIR spectra confirmed the presence of CNCs in the coated
   paper. High-resolution FE-SEM images provided detailed information on
   the surface morphology of the coated papers. The barrier and mechanical
   performances of the coated paper were evaluated using the oil and grease
   resistance KIT, hot oil, water vapor permeability, air permeability,
   water contact angle, tensile index, burst index, percentage of
   elongation, and fold tests. All the coated paper samples passed the hot
   oil test and exhibited the highest KIT rating. The water vapor and air
   resistance values of the coated paper samples increased 14 times and 250
   times, respectively, compared with the uncoated paper samples. The water
   contact angle of the coated paper samples increased to 99.40 degrees
   from 60.13 degrees, and the surface roughness decreased from 2.37 mu m
   to 0.85 mu m. The presence of coating also increased the tensile and
   burst indices by 5.28 times and 1.79 times, respectively, compared with
   the uncoated paper samples. No cytotoxic effects were found in the
   optimized coated paper, and all the samples were fully degraded within
   49 days, as confirmed using the soil biodegradability test. Therefore,
   the coated paper can be a potential alternative to existing single-use
   plastics for packaging materials.},

   of Polyethylene Terephthalate},

Abstract = {The increasing utilization of single-use plastics in the food sector
   poses serious environmental challenges. A circular economy approach,
   i.e., reusing packaging before recycling, offers a promising solution
   but raises concerns about cross-contamination between food products.
   This study investigates how repeated use and cleaning affect the surface
   topography of plastic food packaging and, in turn, how these changes
   influence cleaning efficiency and assessment. Recycled polyethylene
   terephthalate (rPET) trays were subjected to 20 industrial wash cycles
   with and without detergent concentration of 0.3\% v/v at the following
   temperatures: 55 degrees C wash, 70 degrees C rinse. Surface roughness
   was measured using mechanical and optical techniques. Additionally,
   trays were roughened with sandpaper of varying grit sizes to simulate
   mechanical wear during consumer use. Cleanability was assessed using UV
   fluorescence imaging and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assays. Results
   showed no significant increase in surface roughness after 20 wash
   cycles. However, artificially roughened surfaces retained more food
   residue, complicating cleaning. The application of UV fluorescence
   imaging proved more effective than ATP assays in detecting food residues
   on textured surfaces. These findings support the use of advanced imaging
   for evaluating the hygiene of reusable packaging and highlight key
   considerations for implementing circular reuse systems in food
   packaging.},

Abstract = {The global rise in plastic use has severe environmental consequences. To
   combat these consequences, on 1 January 2017, Israel implemented a law
   imposing a levy on single-use plastic bags. This study assessed the
   long-term impact of this levy on plastic bag usage and consumer
   intentions seven years later. It also examined psychological factors,
   social attitudes, and sociodemographic influences on reducing plastic
   bag consumption. Data were collected from 870 Israeli respondents
   through an online survey, and a mediation model was analyzed using path
   analysis with AMOS. The results showed that 44\% of participants
   significantly reduced their disposable plastic bag use due to the
   policy. Overall, levels of intention to reduce plastic bag use ranged
   from moderate to moderately high. Positive attitudes toward the policy,
   stronger instrumental beliefs, and higher levels of subjective norms
   were linked to greater plastic-related environmental concerns, which
   correlated with stronger intentions to reduce plastic use. The findings
   highlight the importance of policy interventions in reducing plastic bag
   usage by shaping attitudes, fostering environmental concerns, and
   motivating behavioral change.},

Abstract = {The food packaging industry remains heavily reliant on single-use
   plastics, which contribute to severe environmental pollution despite
   ongoing recycling efforts. To address this challenge, this study
   presents the successful development of ZnO-doped chitosan nanocomposite
   (CZ10) films as a sustainable alternative for food packaging. Structural
   and morphological characterizations through XRD, FTIR, and FESEM
   confirmed the crystalline nature, functional group interactions, and
   uniform surface morphology, verifying the effective incorporation of ZnO
   into the chitosan matrix. Antimicrobial evaluation revealed that CZ10
   films achieved 81.41\% bacterial mortality against Gram-negative
   Escherichia coli and 84.89\% against Gram-positive Enterococcus
   faecalis, demonstrating broad-spectrum antibacterial activity.
   Biocompatibility analysis showed 96\% cell viability, confirming the
   safety of the films for direct food contact. Furthermore, UV-vis
   analysis of vegetable samples demonstrated the its efficiency in
   preserving food quality by reducing degradation. The novelty of this
   work lies in establishing ZnO-doped chitosan nanocomposites as an
   eco-friendly, biocompatible, and antimicrobial packaging material that
   can significantly reduce food spoilage and provide a sustainable
   solution to replace conventional plastic packaging.},

Title = {Green haemodialysis: comparison of dialysis bags versus fresenius
   granumix at the AOU Policlinico di Modena, Italy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEPHROLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 NOV 1},
Abstract = {BackgroundHaemodialysis (HD) has a significant environmental footprint
   due to its high resource consumption and waste generation. A key
   component is dialysate production, which typically involves mixing
   water, bicarbonate, and a single-use acid concentrate bag for each
   session. An alternative method is the central delivery of acid
   concentrate, prepared on-site using dry powder formulations. This study
   compares the environmental impact of these two delivery systems,
   focusing on waste reduction, elimination of single-use plastic, and
   decreased transport-related emissions.MethodsA detailed life cycle
   assessment (LCA) was carried out using OpenLCA and the Ecoinvent v3.1
   database to compare the traditional acid concentrate bag system with the
   central delivery system (Granumix, Fresenius, Germany). Data on material
   inputs, energy use, waste generation, and transportation were collected.
   Flow diagrams captured the full life cycle of each method, and various
   environmental indicators were analysed, including climate change,
   acidification, and ecotoxicity.ResultsThe Granumix system demonstrated
   considerably lower environmental impact than traditional bag use. It
   reduced climate change potential by 30\% (CO2-equivalent) and freshwater
   ecotoxicity by 15\%. Additional benefits were observed in acidification,
   resource use, and overall emissions, indicating the system's broader
   environmental advantages.ConclusionsThe central delivery of acid
   concentrate using the Granumix system is a more sustainable option for
   HD, significantly reducing environmental burdens across several
   categories. These findings underscore the value of adopting innovative
   delivery models to make essential healthcare treatments more
   environmentally sustainable.},

Title = {Effect of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microplastics on radish and
   carrot growth, nutrient uptake, and physiological stress responses},
Journal = {APPLIED BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY},

Abstract = {The widespread use and improper disposal of plastics in the environment
   lead to microplastic (MP) pollution. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
   plastics are widely used as single-use plastics, and the mass use of
   these plastics is contaminating aquatic and terrestrial environments.
   The transportation of those plastic fragments on agricultural land
   increases the risk to crop production and food safety. Therefore, the
   study aimed to evaluate the effect of polyethylene terephthalate
   microplastics (PET-MPs) on plant growth, nutrient uptake, and
   physiological stress responses. A short-term effect of PET-MPs (0.1 g/L)
   on plant growth was assessed using radish (Raphanus sativus) and carrot
   (Daucus carota var. sativa) grown in half-strength Hoagland solution for
   one week. PET-MPs did not significantly affect plant biomass and
   nutrient uptake by plants. Micronutrients such as Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn
   were mostly increased in roots and decreased in shoot samples of both
   plants with PET-MP treatment compared to the control. Although
   short-term exposure of plants to PET-MPs did not significantly affect
   plant biomass and nutrient uptake, a significant difference was observed
   in the physiological stress responses. Chlorophyll a and b contents were
   significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in radish leaves after PET-MP
   treatment. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the leaves of radish plants
   significantly increased, indicating that the plant was facing abiotic
   stress in PET-MP treatment. This study advances understanding of
   MP-induced phytotoxicity and highlights its potential implications for
   food safety in agroecosystems.},

Abstract = {The growing impact of the climate crisis has raised significant concerns
   due to its profound effects on public health and ecological stability.
   This article explores how the implementation of sustainable practices in
   dentistry can contribute to a more efficient, safe and environmentally
   responsible approach, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals
   outlined in the United Nations' 2030 Agenda. A key focus is on waste
   reduction, which is achieved through the promotion of oral health and
   disease prevention, thereby minimising the waste and carbon emissions
   associated with dental care. In addition, the responsible use of
   resources such as water and energy and the use of environmentally
   sustainable dental materials play a critical role in reducing the
   environmental footprint of dentistry. Key measures such as the recycling
   of single-use plastics are essential to curb pollution and reduce the
   uptake of microplastics by marine ecosystems and humans. Education and
   awareness of sustainability is also essential. This can be promoted by
   integrating sustainable principles into the curriculum of dental courses
   and within scientific committees. Promoting these practices among
   emerging health professionals and researchers will drive the development
   of innovative alternatives that further reduce the environmental impact
   of the field.},

   Deposit-Refund Systems},
Journal = {BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 OCT 2},
Abstract = {The challenge of single-use plastics (SUPs) and packaging waste has
   intensified in recent years, with deposit-refund systems (DRS) emerging
   as one of the most effective solutions. Although DRS improve recycling
   rates, their adoption is often hindered by high setup costs and
   uncertain cost-effectiveness. This study addresses a central question in
   waste management: how to design economically viable and scalable DRS.
   Adopting a design science research strategy, the study proceeds in three
   phases. First, it reviews existing DRS operating modes and identifies
   key design parameters. Second, it tests a set of recommendations,
   `technological rules' in design science, through a scenario-based
   analysis applied to a DRS for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in Italy.
   Third, it generalises the results into a transferable adoption
   procedure. The findings reveal trade-offs between environmental ambition
   and economic sustainability, underscoring the importance of designing
   systems that are adaptable to specific national and regional contexts.
   The study provides policymakers with a structured procedure for adopting
   economically viable DRS aligned with circular economy goals.},

Title = {Microplastic polymer accumulation, distribution, and toxicity in
   sediment of a freshwater tidal marsh, USA},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {221},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) persistence in the environment leads to exposure to
   both wildlife and humans, which is a concern globally. However,
   understanding MP sources, transport pathways, and environmental risks
   from exposure remains limited in many environments. Identifying polymer
   types provides crucial information to address this knowledge gap. This
   study examines MP distribution and polymer composition in sediment from
   the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum, PA, USA, a
   freshwater tidal marsh. We identified 4590 MP particles and 29 polymer
   types using laser direct infrared spectroscopy across five sediment
   cores from four sampling sites. The most abundant polymers were
   polypropylene (PP), polyurethane (PU), and tire rubber. To evaluate
   toxicity, we focused on six common polymers produced internationally:
   polyethylene, PP, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, PU,
   and polystyrene. MP concentrations, polymer diversity, and risks
   increased downstream based on the polymer hazard index and potential
   ecological risk index, indicating environmental danger. We observed
   higher MP concentrations and risks in recent depositional sediments.
   Interestingly, MP concentrations in sediment reported from estuaries
   located across five continents (18 countries) showed no significant
   differences, suggesting shared sources of contamination in global
   estuarine sediments. The global MP burial flux was estimated at
   approximately 0.2 Mt. yr(-1). Our findings highlight that MPs primarily
   originate from polymers commonly used to produce single-use plastic
   products, emphasizing the need for stricter waste management and
   reduction efforts aimed at disposable plastics.},

Abstract = {This study introduces a novel decision support system (DSS) framework to
   model and assess three alternative material -driven logistics networks
   for secondary packaging systems (SPSs) in the fruit and vegetable supply
   chain. These SPSs cover reusable plastic containers (RPCs), single-use
   plastic containers (SPCs), and corrugated cardboard boxes (CCBs). By
   integrating primary data from enterprise resource planning systems with
   Geographic Infounation Systems, the DSS offers high-resolution insights
   into transportation flows, payloads, and environmental emissions. The
   framework captures key lifecycle stages of packaging and distribution
   systems, from the production and use to end-of-life management, enabling
   a robust comparative analysis of environmental perfounance. The proposed
   tool further assists the supply chain's stakeholders in preparing
   environmental reports that account for the impacts generated by their
   annual logistics flows and enables the forecasting of future impacts by
   incorporating estimated flows. Applied to a large-scale logistics
   network of an Italian retailer, the DSS revealed significant trade-offs
   between reusable and singl-use SPSs. The findings underscore the
   importance of data -driven tools for optimizing sustainability in food
   supply chain logistics and suggest avenues for future research to
   enhance the scalability and applicability of DSS frameworks in complex
   supply chains. Copyright (c) 2025 The Authors. This is an open access

Title = {A screening of metal(loid) content in conventional and compostable
   plastic polymers: understanding the sources and the connected
   environmental implications☆},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {375},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution is a well-known environmental issue, yet the
   ecotoxicological implications are still underexplored. In this context,
   attention towards the characterization of chemical additives in plastics
   and their potential risks to both human health and ecosystems is now
   increasing. While significant research has been conducted on organic
   chemicals, data on inorganic additives (e.g., metallic compounds) remain
   limited. In this study, we analyzed the metal(loid) content in different
   types of plastics to better understand the presence of inorganic
   additives in these materials, their distribution across different
   polymer types, and their potential impacts. We investigated pristine
   plastic pellets, single-use plastic materials and recycled plastic
   pellets made from both conventional and compostable polymers. We
   observed a notable enrichment of metal(loid)s (particularly Ti, Al, and
   Zn) across a range of plastic types, especially when comparing
   pre-production pellets with final consumer materials, suggesting that
   these additives are incorporated during the final stages of production.
   Samples of polyethylene terephthalate displayed elevated levels of Sb,
   while compostable plastics exhibited specific trends related to Sn and
   In: they are abundant in the pellets, since they are used as catalyst in
   polymer production. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of
   metal additives in different plastic polymers and across different
   production phases. It highlights the need for characterizing metal(loid)
   content in plastic to understand the potential connected risks.
   Additionally, the findings underscore the role of compostable plastics
   as potential carriers of metal(loid)s to terrestrial and aquatic
   environments, raising concerns about their degradation and impact.},

Abstract = {This paper has looked at the response of plastic manufacturers and
   retailers after introducing the Pakistan Environment Protection Act of
   2019. This paper analyzes the behavior of government, manufacturers and
   retailers using the evolutionary game theory model. This model was used
   to test hypotheses about various characteristics of the three players.
   The main variables selected for this purpose include the probability of
   adoption of business process innovation, the probability of monitoring,
   the income manufacturers and retailers can expect from innovation and
   costs associated with non-compliance with regulations. Furthermore,
   simulation analysis was conducted to examine equilibrium strategies'
   stability. Additionally, a small survey was conducted in Lahore and
   Islamabad on plastic bag manufacturers and retailers to find empirical
   support for our research. This study makes a significant contribution to
   the existing literature on environmental regulations because it
   highlights the conditions in which a ban on plastic bags can effectively
   reduce plastic bag usage. Simulation analysis reveals that environmental
   policies on plastic bags can be more successful if an incentive-based
   approach is used by governments as strict enforcement leads to high
   monitoring costs which is not feasible in the long run. Survey analysis
   provides support to the findings as it shows that retailers and
   manufacturers are discouraged by the high costs of manufacturing and
   distributing environment friendly bags. This study carries significant
   policy implications for key stakeholders; the government should give
   subsidies and tax incentives to manufacturers and retailers for adopting
   business process innovation and using environmentally friendly bags.},

   packaging industry},

Abstract = {The global food packaging industry faces severe environmental challenges
   due to its reliance on plastics and the growing demand for convenience.
   In Europe, food packaging alone accounts for 40.5\% of all plastic
   production, yet only 35\% of this waste is recycled. The purpose of this
   study is to examine business models, technological innovations (like AI,
   IoT, and blockchain) and the relation with customers to support the
   transition to a circular economy in food packaging. The research focuses
   on models such as Safe and Sustainable by Design (SSbD) and reusable and
   returnable packaging systems, evaluating their potential to minimize
   environmental impact. A key aspect of the investigation is consumer
   behavior. While consumers express a preference for sustainable options,
   actual purchasing decisions often prioritize cost and convenience. The
   study explores how emerging technologies are transforming packaging
   design by enhancing product safety and improving supply chain
   transparency. Additionally, regulatory frameworks, particularly within
   the European Union, such as the Single-Use Plastics Directive (SUPD) and
   the Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP), are driving industry-wide
   changes toward sustainability. However, disparities in adoption and
   regulatory compliance on a global scale present significant challenges
   to implementation. The outcome of this study is a set of strategic
   recommendations aimed at policymakers, industry leaders, and
   researchers. These recommendations emphasize the importance of
   harmonizing global regulations to support sustainable packaging
   practices, increasing investment in innovation and infrastructure, and
   balancing the relation between industry and consumers to bridge the gap
   between intention or preferences and action or behavior.},

Title = {Fabrication of PLA-Date Fiber Biocomposite via Extrusion Filament Maker

Abstract = {Biocomposites incorporating bio-based polymers and natural fibers hold
   great promise due to their environmental and economic benefits, though
   their commercial use is still limited by production challenges. This
   study reports the development of polylactic acid (PLA) composite
   filament reinforced with 5 wt\% date palm fibers for fused deposition
   modeling (FDM)-based 3D Printing. The biocomposite is fabricated through
   extrusion and 3D Printing, and its mechanical, thermal, and water
   absorption properties are characterized in this work. Fiber dispersion
   is examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), while tensile
   testing evaluates yield strength, tensile strength, and elongation at
   break. Fracture behavior and failure mechanisms are further analyzed
   through optical microscopy and SEM. The biocomposite shows higher yield
   strength (36.75 MPa) and tensile strength (53.69 MPa), representing
   improvements of 10.12\% and 6.53\%, respectively, compared to in-house
   extruded pure PLA. However, it exhibits lower ductility, as indicated by
   reduced elongation at break. Water absorption is also higher in the
   biocomposite (0.58\%) than in pure PLA (0.10\%). Both materials display
   similar thermal behavior and brittle fracture characteristics. These
   results highlight the reinforcing effect of date palm fibers and the
   role of processing on the behavior/performance of the biocomposite.
   Reinforcing PLA with a small fraction of date palm fibers, an abundant
   natural resource, offers a cost-effective and eco-friendly material,
   particularly suited for single-use plastic products where
   biodegradability and sustainability are essential. This study also
   confirms the suitability of PLA/date palm fiber filament for FDM-based
   3D Printing.},

Abstract = {The aim of the work was to innovate in the field of biodegradable straws
   by valorizing waste materials, specifically spent coffee grounds (SCG),
   in combination with food-grade biopolymers. Biodegradable straws were
   produced using pork gelatin and three starch types (corn, rice, and
   potato) via a dipping technique designed to ensure reproducible layer
   formation and structural stability. The prepared straws were analyzed
   for their physicochemical, antioxidant, textural, and solubility
   properties. Antioxidant potential was assessed using multiple assays
   (FRAP, ABTS, and CUPRAC), along with determinations of total polyphenol
   and flavonoid contents. Texture analysis was conducted to evaluate
   hardness, fracturability, and compression in comparison with commercial
   paper and plastic straws. Biodegradability was examined through
   solubility tests in distilled and seawater. The addition of SCG markedly
   enhanced antioxidant capacity and increased polyphenol and flavonoid
   contents, while starch type influenced mechanical performance, with rice
   starch-based straws showing the highest hardness values. All straws
   demonstrated complete dissolution in both distilled and seawater within
   24 h, confirming rapid biodegradation. The results highlight the dual
   advantage of SCG incorporation: improving functional properties through
   antioxidant enrichment and reinforcing environmental sustainability by
   valorizing food industry waste. This study demonstrates the potential of
   SCG-enhanced straws as a scalable and eco-friendly alternative to
   conventional single-use plastics.},

   plastic pollution in the Philippines},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {220},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Marine habitats provide food and shelter, protect from erosion, filter
   pollutants, and support critical human activities, such as recreation,
   transport, and tourism. However, these ecosystems are increasingly
   vulnerable to plastic waste accumulation, particularly in island nations
   like the Philippines, where single-use plastics predominate in coastal
   regions. With a coastal population of over 70 million people, the
   welfare of the people of the Philippines is at risk from the negative
   impacts of plastic pollution; however, little is known about the impacts
   of plastic on biological processes. As a society that is closely linked
   to the marine environment, we sought to map potential plastic pollution
   exposures across major bodies of water, including beaches, mangroves,
   and coastalconnected systems in the Philippines, and link these
   potential exposures to the resulting biological impacts of plastic
   additives. This analysis found 992 additives associated with marine
   plastic polymers and products nationwide, 143 of which had known impacts
   on gene expression pathways. Gene expression alterations of these
   additives pinpointed pathways related to the immune system, endocrine
   system, and cancer-related processes. Most associated impacts of these
   additives were found in plastic products linked to food and beverage
   packaging. These analyses underscore the need for an improved
   understanding of the consequences of long-term exposure to plastic
   pollution for the protection of marine ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The growing interest in recovering resources from old dumpsites has
   greatly accelerated the adoption of landfill mining (LFM) in recent
   years. This study focuses on assessing the quality of materials
   recovered from diverse legacy waste dumpsites using a strata-based
   approach. The method involved waste characterization, elemental
   analysis, physico-chemical characterization, heavy metals analysis and
   correlation analysis to assess the potential of solid waste samples
   collected from all three layers. Results revealed intriguing patterns in
   waste composition, with an increase in soil like fractions with depth
   and percentage of single-use plastic was almost same in all layers.
   Elemental analysis revealed variations in nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen and
   sulphur content across different layers, showcasing the heterogeneity of
   legacy. There was a small variation in the percentage of carbon in the
   first two layers, indicating high potential for use as fuel in the form
   of refuse-derived fuels. Significant changes were observed in layer 3,
   indicating it is best suited for landfill gas collection. Similar trends
   were observed for other elements. The presence of nitrogen-rich content
   indicates the potential for ammonia production, whereas hydrogen-rich
   materials suggest the possibility of generating hydrogen gas.
   Sulphur-rich waste holds promise for contributing to sulphur dioxide
   production. Correlation analysis was performed to maximize resource
   recovery while minimizing environmental risks.},

Abstract = {In the unique deltaic geography of Bangladesh, mismanaged plastic waste
   presents significant challenges to human health and aquatic ecosystems.
   This is due to insufficient waste management, littering, and improper
   plastic disposal on land. The substitution of plastic with biodegradable
   alternatives in Bangladesh is closely linked to jute products, driven by
   their cultural significance and the longstanding tradition of jute
   cultivation in the Ganges delta. This study utilizes a comprehensive
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) based on International Organization for
   Standardization (ISO) to evaluate jute and plastic bags throughout their
   life cycles, from raw material extraction to disposal. The selected
   functional unit for life cycle assessments is the number of bags
   necessary to carry the annual groceries per person in Bangladesh,
   calculated from the average per capita food requirement of 269.20 kg,
   resulting in 27 bags per capita. The potential carbon footprint for a
   single-use plastic bag is measured at 56.7 g carbon di-oxide equivalent
   (CO2-eq.) while the single-use jute bag results in 313.41 g CO2-eq.,
   marking a fivefold increase compared to the plastic bag. The less
   favorable environmental impacts for single-use jute bags can be
   attributed to their nearly tenfold higher weight than a thin plastic
   bag, necessitating a correspondingly higher quantity of raw materials
   for production. In the category of terrestrial ecotoxicity, the plastic
   bag exhibits substantial disadvantages. The plastic bag outperforms the
   jute bag in 17 out of 18 impact categories in singleuse scenarios.
   However, with multiple uses (ten times), the jute bag demonstrates
   superior performance in most impact categories compared to the
   single-use low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bag. A measure for assessing
   the risk of environmental littering is derived by considering the
   quantity of bags required to fulfill the functional unit, along with
   factors such as weight, surface area, price, and biodegradability. The
   outcomes provided by the littering risk indicator (Ilr) contradict those
   obtained through LCA. The value of Ilr is significantly different
   between the two types of bags, with the jute bag showing a lower value
   of 0.65, indicating minimal environmental litter risk. In contrast, the
   LDPE bag has an alarmingly high value of 29,566, highlighting a
   substantial littering risk. The paper advocates for a more holistic
   assessment to inform sustainable choices better and mitigate
   environmental impacts effectively. Recognizing the limitations of LCA,
   particularly in assessing littering and material persistence, the study
   emphasizes the need to address these constraints in future research.},

Abstract = {This work aimed to develop edible spoons from non-traditional types of
   flour that could help reduce pollution related to the use of plastic
   cutlery. Moreover, the experimentally produced edible spoons were
   fortified with health-enhancing bioactive compounds from non-traditional
   flours. Edible spoons were made by blending different types of flours,
   including acorn, pumpkin seeds, poppy seeds, and wheat, with the
   addition of water to form a homogenous, formable dough. The spoons were
   baked at 180 degrees C for 10 min and subjected to a dryer to achieve an
   even firmer texture. Next, the following parameters were determined:
   total polyphenol content, composition of phenolic compounds, antioxidant
   activity, and the textural profile. The highest total polyphenol content
   was recorded in acorn flour samples, with a value of 14.0 mg GAE/g in
   the sample containing 30 \% acorn flour. This sample also showed the
   highest antioxidant activity with a value of 127.3 mu mol TE/g and the
   highest concentrations of rutin, myricetin, catechin, and naringenin.
   The highest hardness was recorded in the sample with the addition of 10
   \% acorn flour. Our study highlighted a simple and effective method of
   producing edible and biodegradable spoons, offering a sustainable
   alternative to single-use plastic cutlery.},

Abstract = {Antiviral personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g., face masks) could
   extend the service life of single-use PPE and reduce the pollution of
   single-use plastics. However, the prevalence of nanomaterials and
   chemical-embedded antiviral agents can impose environmental and health
   risks when leached. Here, we developed a highly effective and nontoxic
   antiviral coating on commercial textiles using naturalMoringa
   oleiferaseed proteins. A simple dip coating method of polyester textiles
   using seed water extracts was effective because of the rapid
   electrostatic attraction between cationic proteins and negatively
   charged polyesters. The coating time and seed usage were minimized by
   studying the adsorption of protein onto textiles under varying times,
   protein-to-textile ratios, and protein concentrations. In only 15 min,
   the optimized protein coating achieved a similar to 5.4 log10 reduction
   of infectivity of murine hepatitis virus, a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate. Such
   performance is better than or comparable to previously reported
   synthetic materials. The coated textile remained effective after
   repeated viral exposure, dry storage, and UV exposure and can be
   regenerated. This is the first demonstration of Moringa protein coating
   on textiles for broad antiviral PPE applications (respirators and gowns)
   controlling beta-coronaviruses. Such a coating can also be applied as a
   novel disinfection agent for high-touch surfaces.},

Title = {Impact of recycled plastic waste on the corrosion behaviour of steel
   rebar in concrete},
Journal = {CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 APR 16},
Abstract = {This study examines the corrosion behaviour of steel rebar in concrete
   with recycled plastic waste (RPW) from single-use plastics as a partial
   replacement for conventional fine aggregate. The use of RPW in concrete
   helps reduce environmental impact and reliance on natural sand. To
   improve bonding between RPW and the cement matrix, RPW was chemically
   treated. Five RPW content levels (0, 5, 10, 15 and 20\%) and two RPW
   types (treated and untreated) were considered. Concrete permeability was
   evaluated through water absorption, sorptivity and chloride ion
   penetration tests. Corrosion behaviour of embedded steel rebars was
   assessed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and
   potentiodynamic polarisation techniques under accelerated conditions
   with 3.5\% NaCl solution in alternating wet-dry cycles. Open circuit
   potential was monitored throughout. The study revealed that using T-RPW
   fine aggregate reduced water absorption by 16.1\% and increased
   resistance to chloride ion penetration by 17.3\% compared to UT-RPW at a
   20\% replacement level. Additionally, the corrosion rate for T-RPW
   (0.0144 mm/year) was 50\% lower than that of UT-RPW (0.0288 mm/year),
   highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing concrete durability. This
   study highlights both the benefits and limitations of using treated RPW
   as a sustainable alternative in concrete.},

Abstract = {Growing environmental concerns about single-use plastic packaging have
   intensified the search for sustainable, biodegradable materials. This
   work presents the design of environmentally friendly polymer films based
   on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC),
   incorporating lactic acid (LA) and oxalic acid (OA) as cross-linking
   agents to enhance their overall performance. The prepared films were
   characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),
   x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), tensile testing, and soil burial
   degradation studies. Films cross-linked with OA displayed the highest
   biodegradation rate (90\%) and a contact angle of 79 degrees, while
   LA-cross-linked films achieved 80\% biodegradability with improved
   hydrophilicity. Both acids significantly enhanced tensile strength,
   thermal resistance, and barrier properties, making them suitable for
   food packaging. Trials with fruits and vegetables demonstrated their
   ability to maintain freshness and minimize weight loss. Overall, PVA/CMC
   composites represent a renewable, eco-conscious alternative to plastic
   packaging, and further investigation is encouraged to support industrial
   scalability, economic feasibility, and long-term stability.},

Abstract = {While environmental consideration and economic value were once
   considered a trade-off, today, organizations are expected to achieve
   both. Therefore, brands must make decisions and act more conscientiously
   than ever before. This conscientiousness must be integrated into the
   company's competitive products and organizational culture. In conducting
   honest business, considering environmental issues, brands face difficult
   challenges. One prime example is the elimination of plastic bottles.
   Marketing communication strategies that encourage changes in consumer
   attitudes and the use of plastic are required to reduce plastic
   pollution, a worldwide environmental issue. This study examined the
   effects of two stimuli in encouraging a switch from plastic bottles to
   cans: (1) a policy banning single-use plastics for spectators at the
   2024 Paris Olympics and (2) a recent study finding that plastic bottles
   contain large amounts of microplastics. A randomized controlled trial in
   Japan revealed that the Olympic stimulus significantly increased the
   attractiveness of cans compared with plastic bottles; this influence was
   more pronounced among people with higher levels of personal
   innovativeness. This is the first study to extend Olympic
   effects-calculated for economic impacts that can be channeled into
   fiscal and physical urban development-to changes in consumer
   environmental attitudes.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},

Number = {4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The widespread convenience of plastic items in daily life has
   progressively brought the downside of the plastic era to the fore. The
   predominant endurance and recalcitrant nature of plastics has prompted a
   considerable expansion in the proportion of plastics in the ecosystem,
   leading to the build-up of roughly 20 million tonnes of plastics in
   aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems yearly. The necessity of replacing
   plastic products has led to a flurry of research into durable
   alternatives to petroleum-based polymers. In this regard, bioplastics
   have been advocated as an alternative to conventional plastics for many
   purposes, such as single-use plastic bags, throwaway cutlery and
   crockery, and plastic films for mulching in agriculture. Nevertheless,
   doubts have emerged surrounding the environmental sustainability of
   bioplastics, notably concerning micro-and nano-plastic biodegradability
   and the emission of additives, all of which have a decisive impact on
   human health and environment. This study critically considers the
   state-of-the-art in the field based on a systematic literature search
   concerning the future challenges of applying biodegradable polymers as
   an alternative to conventional plastics and their sources, build-up,
   occurrence, hazardousness, environmental and public health impact, waste
   management options, together with bioremediation methods for
   bioplastics.},

Abstract = {Microplastic pollution from plastic fragments accumulating in
   agricultural fields threatens the world's most productive soils and
   environmental sustainability. This is the first paper to address the
   challenge of developing a dynamic economic model to analyze the adoption
   of soil-biodegradable plastic mulches (BDMs) as a sustainable
   alternative to conventional polyethylene mulches. The model considers
   the trade-off between BDM degradation rates and agricultural production,
   seeking to balance the cost of BDMs and the cost of waste disposal. We
   consider both private and social perspectives under deterministic and
   stochastic environments. Our findings suggest that BDMs can
   significantly decrease long-term plastic pollution from single-use
   plastics in agriculture. For example, increasing landfill tipping fees
   incentivizes Washington State tomato growers to optimally adopt BDMs
   with a 61\% degradation rate and to till used BDMs into the soil,
   reducing plastic waste accumulation in landfills. The study highlights
   the role of economic incentives, such as landfill fees, corrective taxes
   and the role of risk aversion, in promoting BDM adoption and curbing
   plastic pollution. The framework presented here offers valuable insights
   for policymakers and stakeholders seeking to foster sustainable
   agricultural practices and mitigate global plastic pollution.},

Title = {Geospatial distribution and anthropogenic litter impact on coastal
   mangrove ecosystems from the Saudi Arabia coast of the Gulf},

Abstract = {Mangrove ecosystems are significantly impacted by marine litter
   pollution, an increasingly important environmental problem. These
   ecosystems, situated at the interface between sea and land, serve as
   critical habitats and act as traps for plastic pollution. This study
   investigated the concentration, source, and composition of marine litter
   on both the mangrove bottom and canopy along the Saudi Arabia coast in
   the Gulf. The observed concentration of surface litter ranged from 0.98
   +/- 0.05 to 2.96 +/- 0.25 items/m(2), with a mean concentration of 1.4
   +/- 0.61 items/m(2) (SD; N = 9). The mean trapped litter was 0.79 +/-
   0.45 items/tree, ranging from 0 to 7 items/tree. Plastic litter
   dominates the mangrove environment, accounting for 80\% of debris items
   on the floor and 43\% of those entangled in the canopy. Single-use
   plastics were the most prevalent type of litter detected across all
   surveyed locations. The sediments within the mangrove ecosystem serve as
   long-term repositories for plastic litter, evaluated through various
   indices, such as General Index, Clean Coast Index, Pollution Load Index,
   and Hazardous Litter Index, to assess the cleanliness of the mangrove
   floor. The Pollution Load Index shows a ``Hazard level I,{''} indicating
   that the mangrove floor is less contaminated. A higher concentration of
   litter was observed in urban areas with greater population density,
   likely originating from terrestrial activities like urban runoff and
   marine activities, particularly fishing.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Waste-to-energy (WtE) projects use municipal waste to generate energy.
   While they increase local environmental and health risks, they also
   generate local environmental and economic benefits. If facility operator
   characteristics influence perceptions of risks and benefits, does public
   support for a WtE facility change if it is operated by a foreign firm?
   Using a survey experiment in Thailand (n = 829), we examine support for
   a hypothetical WtE plant operated by local Thai (reference category),
   Japanese (treatment 1), and Chinese (treatment 2) firms. We find that
   while respondents are less supportive of WtE plants operated by Chinese
   companies ({''}penalty for foreignness{''}), their support does not
   change for Japanese plants (neither penalty nor premium for
   foreignness). Importantly, while perceptions of local economic benefits
   increase support, perceptions of environmental benefits from reducing
   waste and landfills do not. Respondents support WtE plants when their
   communities experience air pollution from coal-fired power plants and
   when they support the Thai government's decision to ban the
   manufacturing and sale of single-use plastics.},

Abstract = {Background There is increasing evidence that microplastics exert harmful
   effects on human health and on the ocular surface. This pilot study aims
   to investigate if microplastic particles are present in commonly used
   eyedrops in single-use plastic vials. Methods Six commonly used
   commercial tear-replacement solutions available without a doctor's
   prescription were tested (Brands A-F). All brands of eyedrops were
   analysed visually using light microscopy and the number of microplastic
   particles were manually counted. These were further analysed using the
   Agilent 8700 Laser Direct Infrared (LDIR) chemical imaging system.
   Results All eyedrops analysed contained microplastics. The number of
   particles identified using light microscopy ranged between 15 (Brand E)
   to >18,000 (Brand F). In total, nine types of microplastics were
   identified with LDIR - polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene,
   polyvinylchloride, polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate,
   polymethylmethacrylate, polyamide and polyurethane. Conclusions This
   study provides the most extensive quantification of microplastic
   contamination in commercial eyedrops to date, highlighting a major,
   under-recognised source of ocular exposure. These particles may arise
   from secondary degradation of plastic vials during production,
   transportation, storage, or during instillation, or introduced from
   other sources during production and represent a major source of exposure
   to the ocular surface, especially among patients who require chronic
   instillation of eyedrops.},

   limited water exchange and high anthropogenic pressure exacerbate
   pollution risks. This study presents the first large-scale, standardized
   assessment of marine litter along the Turkish Black Sea coastline, based
   on surveys conducted at 37 stations spanning diverse coastal settings. A
   total of 29,610 litter items were recorded, with an average density of
   0.80 +/- 0.07 items/m2, and plastics accounted for 88.2 \% of all
   collected items. The most frequently encountered items were single-use
   plastics, including cigarette butts, food wrappers, and bottle caps.
   According to the Clean Coast Index (CCI), the majority of beaches ranged
   from ``moderate{''} to ``very dirty,{''} with the highest pollution
   levels observed in the eastern part of the coastline. The Plastic
   Abundance Index (PAI) further classified beaches as having
   ``moderate{''} to ``very high{''} plastic pollution. Additionally, the
   Hazardous Item Index (HII) revealed considerable spatial variation, with
   some sites showing high concentrations of potentially dangerous litter
   such as syringes, broken glass, and sharp metal objects. While some
   spatial variability was noted among stations, statistical analyses
   indicated no significant differences in overall litter density or
   composition across the six defined basins. These findings highlight the
   pervasive and hazardous nature of plastic pollution in the region and
   emphasize the need for basin-wide monitoring programs, harmonized
   methodologies, and integrated waste management strategies.},

Title = {Carbon footprint reduction in shoulder surgery by the rationalisation of
   single-use convenience packs},
Journal = {SHOULDER \& ELBOW},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 AUG 19},
Abstract = {Introduction The United Kingdom National Health Service is responsible
   for a vast carbon footprint, with annual carbon dioxide emissions at
   over 25 million tonnes. Operating theatres contribute up to 25\% of a
   hospital's emissions.Aims To rationalise the composition of the
   single-use convenience packs in arthroscopic and open shoulder surgery,
   to reduce the annual carbon footprint.Methods The individual material
   composition of all items in the single-use shoulder arthroscopy and open
   shoulder convenience packs was considered. The carbon footprint of each
   item was calculated by the application of best available cradle-to-gate
   emission factors. The items in the packs were then rationalised by
   consensus (of surgeons and scrub team). Two new standardised packs were
   designed.Results In the 2022/2023 financial year, 296 arthroscopic and
   191 open shoulder procedures were performed. The new rationalised open
   packs had between 3 and 18 fewer items, the new arthroscopic packs 7-8
   fewer items. This will result in reduction of 108.9 kg of single use
   plastics, and an overall annual carbon footprint reduction of 643.8
   kgCO2e.Conclusion Through a simple method of single-use convenience pack
   rationalisation, we have reduced the annual carbon footprint of shoulder
   surgery at our institution. The same methodology is being applied to all
   orthopaedic packs.},

Abstract = {The enzymatic depolymerization of single-use plastic products, primarily
   made from poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), is now a reality. Herein,
   we report the development of an innovative tandem system process that
   uses engineered enzymes and Escherichia coli strains to depolymerize PET
   and convert the resulting products into enantiomers of alanine, useful
   amino acids, and starting point for further valorization processes. A
   biosynthetic pathway has been generated, consisting of twelve enzymes
   derived from four different microorganisms. This pathway has been
   optimized using recombinant proteins and whole-cells that harbor
   different modules of the pathway. Specifically, the S101N/F243T-Delta
   LCC variant was selected to degrade PET into terephthalic acid (TPA) and
   ethylene glycol also at 37 degrees C, a temperature compatible with the
   E. coli RARE strain. A recombinant E. coli strain catalyzed the
   subsequent conversion of TPA into 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid, which
   is then transformed into pyruvate by recombinant enzymes to prevent
   depletion of pyruvate due to cellular catabolism. Finally, pyruvate is
   enzymatically aminated to enantiopure d- or l-alanine. We successfully
   converted postconsumer PET waste into d- and l-alanine, with an overall
   yield of 50 mg/170 mg PET, demonstrating that the bioconversion of
   selected plastics into valuable biomolecules via an eco-friendly process
   is feasible.},

Abstract = {The research summarises 10 years of beach litter studies on the southern
   Baltic coast. Beach litter abundance in 2020-2024 was related to results
   from 2015 to 2019. Litter was collected from 15 sections (1 km) in four
   seasons yearly. The changes and trends in marine litter composition and
   sources were identified, taking into account the impact of the COVID-19
   pandemic and the implementation of the Single Use Plastic (SUP)
   Directive (EU, 2019). In 2020-2024 litter classified as artificial
   polymer material was dominant along the studied beaches (64.3 \%) with
   cigarette butts being the most commonly found litter type. 53.1 \% of
   all litter came from tourism and recreational activities. The COVID-19
   pandemic has reduced the beach litter abundance by about half in 2021
   and 2022, mainly by lowering tourist activity. It is unclear whether the
   regulations resulting from the SUP Directive have significantly affected
   the amount of beach litter due to the masking effect of the pandemic,
   which coincided with the introduction of the Directive. However, it
   should be emphasised that the total number of SUP litter in 2020-2024,
   compared to 2015-2019, was lower by over 50 \%. Moreover, cutlery,
   trays, straw and stirrers were not present in the top ten litter items
   in 2020-2024 as they were in 2015-2019. Based on the EU threshold value
   (20 items/100 m), Good Environmental Status (GES) was achieved in all
   assessed areas: the Eastern Gotland Basin Polish coastal waters (9.2
   items/100 m), Bornholm Basin Polish coastal waters (16.6 items/100 m)
   and Gdan<acute accent>sk Basin Polish coastal waters (15.2 items/100 m)
   in 2016-2021.},

Abstract = {Plastic is now a globally acknowledged pollutant. The current annual
   production of plastic worldwide is over 400 million tonnes, of which
   more than 40\% is contributed by single-use plastic, resulting in
   plastic waste. This plastic garbage degrades into finer particles termed
   microplastics (less than 1 mm) and nano-plastics (less than 1 mu m),
   together known as micro-nano-plastics (MNPs). Because of their
   endurance, they may remain in the environment for several decades, and
   their low density can easily be dispersed by wind and sea waves, often
   traveling thousands of kilometers. Due to these characteristics, MNPs
   are omnipresent now. Humans get exposed to these MNPs regularly, mainly
   through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact. Huge quantities of
   MNPs have been reported in the ocean around the globe, and through this,
   they enter the seafood and further into humans. Additionally, MNPs have
   been detected in processed food and beverages such as beer, tea bags,
   and table salt. Once MNPs enter the body, they accumulate in the
   tissues, enter the bloodstream, and affect various cellular pathways.
   So, the hazard assessment results from various studies on MPs and NPs
   are diverse and sometimes conflicting, most likely due to the use of
   research models and the diversity of the MNPs (varying size, shape, and
   composition). Therefore, considering these parameters this review will
   thoroughly evaluate the possible impact of MNP exposure on the
   gastrointestinal system and further amplifications on human health.},

Title = {Impact of single-use waste reduction initiatives using citizen science
   data: Western Australia as a case study},

Abstract = {Single-use plastic (SuP) waste reduction initiatives have emerged
   globally to curb the increasing issue of plastic pollution. However,
   evaluation of their impact on the marine environment is difficult due to
   spatial and temporal variation of debris and the need for regular
   monitoring. This study aimed to determine whether a frequent
   community-driven beach debris collection approach could provide quality
   data to evaluate the impact of recent (2019-2024) waste reduction
   initiatives in Western Australia (WA). The citizen science (CS) program
   commenced in January 2023 at Bathers Beach, Fremantle, WA, with a
   purpose built `bin' installed to provide beach users with a place to
   donate debris. From February 2023 to November 2024, 19,998 items were
   analysed with 17,263 (86 \%) classified as marine debris, and 6615 (38
   \%) of these items classed as single-use. Of the 26 single-use items
   targeted by WA's waste reduction initiatives, 21 were found on the
   beach. Under the `best-case' scenario, a 17 \% reduction in marine
   debris is possible from these initiatives, with significant reductions
   in takeaway beverage plastic lids and cigarette butts already detected
   (p < 0.05). Moreover, findings were comparable with data collected via
   the national standardised CS beach litter monitoring program (i.e.,
   Australian Marine Debris Initiative (AMDI) over a similar period
   (2023-2024)). This suggests the trends detected at Bathers Beach are
   indicative of the broader region. Incorporation of this data into the
   AMDI Database could provide additional information for policy and
   decision makers to evaluate single-use waste reduction initiative
   impact, with significant trends detectable within two years.},

Abstract = {Background Climate change is a huge public health threat, necessitating
   reductions in carbon emissions, particularly from single-use plastics
   like non-sterile gloves (NSG). This quality improvement project aims to
   explore whether use of targeted educational material changes staff
   attitudes towards NSG use in clinical practice within a Sexual Health
   and HIV department.Methods A pre-intervention survey was circulated to
   all clinicians. Subsequently, various methods encouraged appropriate NSG
   use including video guidance of performing venepuncture without gloves
   in line with Trust policy, educational presentations, and patient-facing
   posters for waiting rooms. NSG procurement data were obtained, and a
   post-intervention survey evaluated whether NSG use had changed following
   the interventions.Results Sixty-three percent of staff believed they had
   reduced their personal glove use in the past year. Many staff believed
   the best way to reduce inappropriate glove use was through education as
   well as empowering patients through posters. Glove procurement data
   comparing 2023/2024 to pre-COVID 2019/2020 showed a 45.2\% decrease in
   NSG orders from 173,110 to 94,800 per year.Conclusions Staff education
   is successful in reducing inappropriate NSG use, with patient posters
   and targeted staff presentations the most effective measures to drive
   behaviour change and therefore reduce NSG use.},

Title = {Plastic pollution in shooting ranges and warfare areas - an overlooked
   environmental issue},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {277},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Shooting ranges and military training fields, including warfare-impacted
   areas, have been widely recognized as environmentally impacted zones by
   inorganic and organic contamination, such as heavy metals, polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons or explosive-related compounds. However, the
   possible contamination by plastics and microplastics in soil has been
   widely overlooked despite potential plastic sources, such as shotgun
   cartridges, plastic wads or landmines. Due to how these activities
   occur, plastics have remained in the field for decades or centuries,
   favoring their conversion from macro to microplastics, polluting the
   soil and water resources. Moreover, shooting and recreational activities
   such as airsoft or paintball practices could also be a substantial
   source of plastics to ecosystems; once shot, pellets can have
   conventional or biodegradable plastics in their composition, and there
   left in the environment, favouring impacts on soil properties. Although
   some initiatives have emerged to avoid the use of single-use plastics in
   shotgun ammunition, alternative materials (biodegradable plastics) can
   also be a potential risk, favouring the heavy metal bioavailability of
   shot pellets. These emerging pollutants should also be considered in
   these areas to understand if they could be a potential source of micro-
   and nanoplastics to the environment and, therefore, an environmental
   concern that requires changes at industrial and regulatory levels.},

   Comparative Case Study in Taiwan},
Journal = {RECYCLING},

Abstract = {Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is commonly used in beverage container
   manufacturing; however, its classification as a single-use plastic
   significantly contributes to environmental pollution. Improper disposal
   results in enduring contamination of both terrestrial and marine
   ecosystems, which poses ecological and health risks. Among the disposal
   methods, recycling, incineration, and landfilling, only recycling
   promotes a circular economy by reducing reliance on landfills,
   alleviating emissions, and conserving fossil resources. This study
   employs the life cycle assessment (LCA) method to evaluate the
   environmental impacts of three PET bottle recycling facilities in
   Taiwan, considering collection, transportation, and processing in the
   system boundary. It also assesses the effects of raw material
   composition, comparing transparent, colored, and mixed PET bottles. The
   results indicate that facilities processing colorless PET have lower
   environmental damage values (16.6-18.1 mPt<middle dot>kg-1 of recycled
   flakes) than those handling colored and oil-trapped PET (25 mPt<middle
   dot>kg-1) due to higher energy demands and poly aluminum chloride usage
   in wastewater treatment. Granulation was identified as a significant
   environmental hotspot for recycled PET pellets, with a damage value of
   35 mPt<middle dot>kg-1. Integrating renewable energy and recycled PET
   into PET bottle manufacturing could significantly reduce their
   environmental impacts. Policy recommendations include adopting renewable
   energies as the source energy, calibrating the use of chemicals in
   recycling facilities, and mandating minimum recycled content in PET
   products to enhance circularity.},

Title = {Toward National Guidelines for Biodegradable and Compostable
   Bioplastics: A Case Study in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur,
   Malaysia},

Abstract = {Malaysia has committed to phasing out single-use plastics as part of its
   national sustainability agenda; however, the specific regulatory
   guidelines for implementing biodegradable and compostable bioplastics
   remain underdeveloped. This study aims to formulate practical and
   scalable guidelines for biodegradable and compostable bioplastic
   products, with a focus on the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur as a
   pilot case. Using a stakeholder-driven approach, a series of focus group
   discussions (FGDs) was conducted with key representatives from
   government bodies and the bioplastics industry. The guideline
   development process encompassed the identification and standardisation
   of terminology, definition of scope, certification frameworks,
   regulatory alignment, implementation strategies, and compliance
   mechanisms. The findings reveal a consensus among stakeholders on the
   need for clear and harmonised definitions to prevent ambiguity, as well
   as for certification protocols and enforcement mechanisms to align with
   existing legal frameworks. Revisions were proposed to terms, scope, and
   timelines to ensure legal compatibility and practical enforceability.
   The proposed guideline framework offers substantial potential for
   national adoption, contingent on inclusive stakeholder engagement across
   all Malaysian states to ensure uniformity and contextual relevance in
   its implementation. This study advances Malaysia's SDG commitments by
   promoting sustainable bioplastics guidelines, encouraging national
   adoption through stakeholder engagement, and emphasising future
   integration of the life cycle assessment (LCA) to enhance the policy's
   impact.},

   Reflection of Urban Waste Mismanagement},

Abstract = {Microplastic (MP) pollution has emerged as a significant environmental
   issue, especially within urban riverine systems affected by inadequate
   waste management practices. This research examined the spatial
   distribution, morphological characteristics, and polymer composition of
   MPs in the Weras Ganga and Bolgoda North Lake, Sri Lanka, with
   particular attention to the impact of the nearby Karadiyana Open Dump
   (KOD). Water and sediment samples were collected from 15 sites and
   analyzed utilizing Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy for MP
   identification. The findings indicated a predominance of fibers (>50\%)
   in both water and sediments, with the highest concentrations located
   near the KOD, suggesting substantial contributions from textile and
   synthetic waste. Polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene were
   identified as the most prevalent polymer types, pointing to
   contributions from consumer packaging and industrial waste. Correlation
   analysis disclosed a moderate positive association between MP
   concentrations and physicochemical parameters such as turbidity and
   temperature, underscoring their role in MP transport and deposition
   processes. Sediment samples consistently showed higher MP concentrations
   than water, highlighting their function as a reservoir for MPs. The
   results underscore the pressing need for integrated waste management
   strategies, including a reduction in single-use plastics and
   enhancements in recycling infrastructure, to alleviate MP contamination
   in freshwater ecosystems. This research provides important insights into
   MP pollution dynamics in tropical urban rivers and stresses the
   necessity for specific interventions to safeguard aquatic ecosystems and
   public health.},

Title = {Sustainable food packaging system: Status of regulatory initiatives and
   issues on plastic use in Tunisia, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania African

Abstract = {Background: Sustainable food packaging is not only an environmental
   necessity, but also a crucial part of the broader strategy to reduce
   food waste and promote sustainable development in Africa, as in all
   countries around the world. Scope and approach: The review gives an
   overview of the current landscape of food packaging systems in Africa,
   with a specific focus on Tunisia, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, countries
   actively involved in sustainable food packaging researches under the EU
   Horizon2020 FoodLAND project. The analysis begins with a description of
   the most used packaging materials and highlights the environmental and
   health issues of fossil-based plastics. National policies aimed at
   reducing plastic use and pollution are then examined. Finally, some
   relevant studies on bio-based alternatives using local resources are
   reviewed. Key findings and conclusions: The development of sustainable
   food packaging in Africa faces major challenges, but also holds a great
   potential. The continent is still largely reliant on traditional (e.g.
   plant leaves) and conventional (e.g. fossil-based plastics) materials.
   The former offer limited food protection, while the latter contribute to
   environmental pollution. Some policy/regulatory initiatives have been
   introduced to reduce plastic use, their effect is often limited due to
   several challenges. The reviewed studies demonstrate the interest of the
   African scientific communities on sustainable packaging solutions,
   however most of them remain at lab-scale and need validation. Customised
   approaches that consider the different socio-economic and cultural
   realities of African countries can help overcome current limitations of
   local packaging system, especially through collaboration between
   academia, industry and policy makers.},

   Indonesia},
Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 NOV 16},
Abstract = {The central Javan city of Semarang has a population of 2 million people
   and annually receives over 2000 mm of rainfall. Intensive development in
   the Semarang River catchment has polluted surface waters precluding
   their use as a potable supply. This has led to the abstraction of
   groundwater as the main potable source, distributed via single use
   plastic bottles. Unsustainable groundwater exploitation has resulted in
   >> 8 cm/yr of subsidence contributing to the inundation of many coastal
   residences, as well as loss of productive land and public
   infrastructure. Hard coastal barriers and the channelization of rivers
   to minimize flooding are among proposed mitigation measures. The
   long-term effectiveness of these actions is limited and over one million
   residents could be at risk of marine inundation by 2050. Thus, an
   adaptation pathways approach to mitigate subsidence is proposed aimed at
   substituting groundwater abstraction through: (1) constructing small
   water supply reservoirs in protected, upper catchment areas; (2)
   capturing and filtering rainwater to provide a decentralized
   alternative, and (3) mitigating pollution to reestablish more plentiful
   surface water supplies. Once the rate of subsidence is eased, mangrove
   restoration and targeted engineering may be capable of reinstating a
   hydrogeological balance and accommodating climate-driven sea level rise.},

Title = {Full conversion of grass biomass into sustainable functional
   antimicrobial bioplastics},

Abstract = {The environmental impact of non-degradable single-use plastics poses a
   significant challenge to current sustainability efforts. To foster a
   sustainable circular economy, this study introduces grass biomass as a
   renewable resource for the production of innovative bioplastics. The
   research involves the direct conversion of grass waste into composite
   bioplastics through alkaline hydrolysis, offering a transformative
   approach to plastic manufacturing. The hydrolysis process was optimized
   by varying treatment times and alkaline concentrations, with the ideal
   conditions identified as 1 M NH3 and 24 hours of treatment.
   Subsequently, the incorporation of epsilon-polylysine (PL) enhanced the
   mechanical properties of the bioplastics by acting as a plasticizer.
   Mechanical testing revealed that samples containing 10\% and 20\% PL
   exhibited comparable rigidity, with a Young's modulus of approximately
   700 MPa and a tensile strength of 10 MPa. Moreover, the addition of PL,
   up to 20\%, significantly improved the water resistance of the
   bioplastics, evidenced by decreased moisture content and water
   solubility. Additionally, the bioplastics demonstrated effective
   antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus
   aureus, as well as significant antioxidant activity. Life cycle
   assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCAA) results demonstrate the
   potential environmental benefits of manufacturing grass biomass into
   plastic films, with a significant reduction in greenhouse gases,
   cumulative energy demand (CED), and cost when compared to benchmark
   packaging plastics. These promising properties indicate that these
   biomaterials could be effectively utilized in real-world applications,
   with potential application as sustainable biobased packaging materials.},

Title = {Turning tobacco Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) into Extended
   Producer Liability (EPL): critical safeguards for the UN Plastics Treaty},
Journal = {TOBACCO CONTROL},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 AUG 12},
Abstract = {Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is recognised as a valuable tool
   for environmental management of products' end-of-life impacts; it was
   featured in all the draft negotiating text for the future UN Plastics
   Treaty. However, when applied to the tobacco industry, its
   implementation faces significant challenges due to the industry's
   historical manipulation of health policies. This study explores the
   inherent contradictions in using EPR schemes for tobacco products, which
   are designed to make producers `stewards' for the life cycle of their
   products, including end-of-life impacts. The study highlights the
   potential for tobacco companies to exploit these schemes to weaken
   health regulations and greenwash their public image. By examining
   frameworks like the European Union Single-Use Plastics Directive
   alongside the UN Plastics Treaty negotiations, the study stresses the
   need for stringent safeguards to ensure EPR schemes do not serve as
   tools for greenwashing but support health and environmental objectives.
   The study also proposes enhanced regulatory measures, such as redefining
   EPR for tobacco as `Extended Producer Liability' and integrating it with
   WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control guidelines.},

Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {This study explores the attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived
   behavioral control of Dhaka city residents toward plastic pollution,
   using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a framework. A
   cross-sectional survey of 435 participants was conducted online,
   targeting adults (>= 18 years) with internet access. The survey
   consisted of 10 items each for attitude, subjective norms, and perceived
   behavioral control, analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple
   regression to identify associations with sociodemographic factors such
   as age, education, and income. Findings indicate that respondents
   generally hold positive attitudes toward reducing plastic pollution,
   with 39.77\% agreeing to purchase environmentally sustainable products
   despite higher costs and 44.83\% willing to reduce single-use plastics
   even when offered for free. However, adoption of reusable alternatives
   remains low, with only 28.97\% using their bags when shopping.
   Subjective norms showed moderate influence, with 43.68\% of respondents
   indicating that people around them affect their plastic usage, though
   many lacked social pressure to adopt environmentally friendly behaviors.
   The study also highlights practical barriers, including the low
   availability of biodegradable alternatives (4.37\%), lack of effective
   plastic waste segregation, and limited community-level campaigns. The
   36-45 age group showed a significant negative association with perceived
   behavioral control, while higher education positively influenced
   attitudes toward plastic reduction. The study emphasizes the need for
   supportive policies, reward systems, and infrastructure to translate
   positive attitudes into sustainable behaviors. These findings offer
   valuable insights for policymakers aiming to improve plastic pollution
   management in Dhaka and other developing urban areas.},

Title = {Efficient and green synthesis of dimethyl succinate via
   palladium-catalyzed acetylene dicarbonylation assisted by
   methanedisulfonic acid under ambient conditions},
Journal = {APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL},

Abstract = {With the implementation of global single-use plastic restrictions, the
   demand for biodegradable plastics has increased substantially. As a key
   raw material for synthesizing polybutylene succinate (PBS) through
   transesterification polymerization, dimethyl succinate (DMS) has
   demonstrated growing market demand. Efficient and green synthesis
   technologies for DMS production is now a critical priority. In this
   study, methanedisulfonic acid (MDSA) was introduced into the acetylene
   dicarbonylation reaction for the first time. The results demonstrated
   that the addition of MDSA can achieve a relatively high yield under
   ambient conditions. PdBr2, MDSA, and PdBr2-MDSA have been characterized
   by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) and Single-Crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD)
   confirmed the coordination between Pd(II) and MDSA. The electrons
   transferred from the -SO3H group to Pd(II) enhanced the catalytic
   activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the
   negative inductive effect of -SO3H groups at both ends of the MDSA
   molecule induced a positive charge on the connected -CH2- moiety. The
   effects of parameters including catalyst dosage, proportion of
   promoters, reaction temperature and reaction time on the combined yield
   of DMS, dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and dimethyl maleate (DMM) have been
   systematically investigated. Under the optimal conditions, the combined
   yield achieved up to 87.82 \%. This study demonstrates a green and
   energy-efficient route for DMS synthesis with reduced carbon emissions,
   offering a promising strategy for industrial applications.},

Title = {Contrasting Microplastic Characteristics in Macroinvertebrates from Two
   Independent but Adjacent Rivers in Kruger National Park, South Africa},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},
Number = {11},
Month = {MAY 23},
Abstract = {Freshwater macroinvertebrates, often used as indicators of environmental
   quality for freshwater ecosystems, may be compromised by microplastics
   (MPs). We investigated MPs occurring in benthic filter feeder, predator,
   and grazer macroinvertebrates collected from the catchment-independent
   but adjacent Olifants and Sabie rivers of Kruger National Park as
   duplicates. We counted 369 MPs in 376 organisms (1.0 n/organism) with a
   mean of 8.8 n/organism, 8.5 n/organism, and 0.16 n/organism in filter
   feeders, predators, and grazers, respectively. Based on MP colour, size,
   and morphotype, significant differences in proportional compositions
   between predatorial macroinvertebrates and all other macroinvertebrates
   in both rivers preclude predatorial macroinvertebrates as a proxy
   indicator for the other macroinvertebrates. Proportional compositions of
   MP characteristics in macroinvertebrates differed in all respects
   between the two adjacent rivers, except for one aspect. Microplastic
   morphotypes occurred in equal proportions in macroinvertebrates of both
   rivers, suggesting biological selection based on morphotype but not MP
   colour or size. We found little evidence of trophic transfer between
   feeding guilds. Of the six polymer types observed (n = 50), butyl and
   chlorobutyl dominated. Waste mismanagement, single-use plastics,
   inefficient wastewater treatment plants, mining, and road transportation
   may be the major MP pollution sources that need mitigation.
   Microplastics in freshwater ecosystems of nature conservation areas need
   more attention due to high biodiversity that may be exposed.},

Title = {Italian Gen Z and sustainable coastal tourism: a segmentation analysis
   of knowledge, attitudes and pro-environmental behaviours},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TOURISM FUTURES},

Abstract = {PurposeCoastal and marine tourism (CMT) is facing environmental
   challenges that may prove critical in the near future. A shift towards
   sustainable approaches is required. Investigating the approach of
   today's youth, who represent an important segment of the general and
   tourist populations, can foster this change. The aim of this study is to
   investigate the knowledge, opinions, attitudes and behaviour among the
   Italian Gen Z in relation to coastal and marine environments and the
   sustainability of CMT and to perform a segmentation of young people's
   profiles.Design/methodology/approachA survey of 778 students was
   performed. Descriptive statistics, tests and cluster analyses were
   applied.FindingsTwo-thirds of the participants are convinced that
   tourism activities may interfere with the protection of marine and
   coastal environments. Likewise, they are largely convinced that the
   quality of these environments could affect tourism. The respondents'
   environmental behaviour is mainly related to the issues of litter and
   single-use plastics. Gender and area of residence significantly affect
   the respondents' knowledge of marine sustainability topics, some of
   their behavioural attitudes and their future perspectives. The
   educational field is significant for many phenomena. The cluster
   analysis detected five groups, ranging from a distant profile to one
   more interested in sustainable marine tourism whose members are involved
   and have a strong environmental attitude.Originality/valueThe study
   gives an original contribution to the literature on generational cohorts
   and young people's perspectives on future scenarios of sustainable
   coastal and marine tourism.},

Title = {Anthropogenic litter pollution in the mangrove blue carbon ecosystem:
   Unveiling the spatial distribution, composition, source delineation and
   mitigation measures along the Goa coast, India},

Abstract = {Plastic litter pollution has emerged as a critical environmental issue
   globally, and coastal habitats are particularly vulnerable to its
   detrimental effects. The west coast of India, renowned for its rich
   biodiversity and vibrant ecosystems, is facing escalating challenges due
   to the increasing prevalence of mismanaged plastic litter. However, the
   scale of plastic accumulation in the coastal environment in this region
   remains largely unknown due to limited research. This study aims to
   comprehensively assess the extent, sources, and impacts of plastic
   litter in coastal mangroves, an important blue carbon habitat, along the
   Goa coast, and propose effective mitigation strategies. Our findings
   reveal alarming levels of plastic litter in the study areas. The mean
   concentration of trapped litter was estimated at 5.14 +/- 0.55 items/m2
   (ranged 3.3 - 12 items/m2). Overall, plastic was the most significant
   litter type, contributing to 66 \% of the total litter accumulation.
   Source identification analysis suggests that 89 \% of the litter in the
   mangrove originated from local land-based sources. Common plastic items
   identified include plastic fragments, single-use plastic items and
   fishing gear. Four indices-Clean Coast Index (CCI), General Index (GI),
   Hazardous Items Index (HII), and Clean Environment Index (CEI)-were used
   to evaluate environmental and health risks of the mangrove habitats.
   Mangrove pneumatophores and branches were observed to be impaired by
   entangled plastic. Additionally, trapped plastic may pose a serious risk
   to mangrove biodiversity, disrupt the ecological balance, and impact
   human health through the food chain. The study recommends sustainable
   mitigation strategies, including policy reforms, community engagement,
   and educational initiatives, to address plastic pollution in important
   blue-carbon ecosystems like mangroves. By adopting a multidisciplinary
   approach, present study contributes valuable insights and actionable
   recommendations to safeguard the coastal ecosystems, preserve
   biodiversity, and ensure sustainable development in the region.},

Title = {Bio-contaminated plastic micropipette tip sterilization stations:
   Environmentally, economically, and energetically viable solution},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {Bioscientific research laboratories significantly contribute to global
   plastic waste production through their use of plastic products, such as
   single-use micropipette tips. Biologically contaminated pipette tips
   must undergo several washing and sterilization steps before being reused
   or recycled. There is a dearth of available research studying the
   feasibility of pipette tip washing and sterilization in research
   laboratories. While automated tip- washing systems are available
   commercially for tip decontamination and reuse, the high initial
   purchasing cost of these washing stations and concerns related to
   washing efficiency deter many research laboratories from incorporating
   them. To mitigate these concerns, considering the University of Texas at
   Austin as an example, we performed a cost-benefit analysis of employing
   a university-wide pipette tip washing station. We estimated that only a
   single-time reuse of pipette tips could result in a 100\% return on
   investment from the equipment. Additionally, preliminary analysis shows
   that pipette tip recycling can result in significant energy and water
   savings. With pilot experiments, we replicated UV-based decontamination
   steps employed by the commercial equipment and found the washing to be
   100\% efficient in sterilizing pipette tips contaminated with
   bacteriophage, DNA, and RNA. Decontaminated pipette tips were used to
   conduct phage quantification to demonstrate the feasibility of reuse for
   biological assays. Finally, we proposed an alternative autoclave-based
   sterilization method that can be used in individual research labs to
   decontaminate pipette tips. We found autoclave-based washing to be 100\%
   efficient in sterilizing pipette tips contaminated with bacteriophage,
   whereas it is not efficient enough to decontaminate DNA and RNA.},

Title = {Efficient Beach Litter Monitoring: Accelerated Surveys of Pollution
   Hotspots-A North African Case Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Marine litter is a critical environmental issue, with beach litter being
   its most visible indicator. Despite severe pollution on Mediterranean
   beaches, Tunisia currently lacks a national beach litter monitoring
   program. To address this gap and support the development of such a
   program, particularly at pollution hotspots like urban beaches, we
   conducted a one-year study on six Tunisian beaches. We employed an
   innovative, accelerated multiple 10 m transect method tailored to highly
   polluted beaches, focusing on macro-litter (>2.5 cm). This method
   significantly reduces survey time compared to the standard 100 m
   approach while maintaining comparable pollution metrics, offering a
   practical and efficient solution for areas with high litter density. Our
   findings reveal an average litter density of 1.01 +/- 1.08 pieces/m(2),
   with higher pollution in urban areas. Based on the Clean Coast Index
   (CCI), two beaches were classified as extremely dirty, one as dirty, two
   as moderately clean, and one as clean. Plastics (59.2\%) and cigarette
   butts (21.1\%) were the most prevalent pollutants, with single-use
   plastics comprising 52.5\% +/- 5.3\% of total litter. Most of the litter
   (60.6\%) originated from shoreline activities and poor waste management.
   These findings underscore the urgent need for a long-term national beach
   litter monitoring program. The integration of our accelerated transect
   method would enable efficient, effective surveys on highly polluted
   beaches, providing critical data to address litter sources and support
   targeted strategies for mitigating pollution and protecting Tunisia's
   coastal ecosystems.},

Title = {Uncovering heterogeneous effects of message framing to promote reusable
   cup use: A causal forest approach},

Abstract = {This study investigated the impact of message framing strategies on
   promoting reusable cups adoption among South Korean consumers, amid
   growing global concerns about single-use plastic waste. For this
   research, we conducted a survey experiment with 1,316 respondents and
   analyzed their responses to gain framing (discounts for using reusable
   cups) and loss framing (additional charges for using single-use cups).
   We also applied causal forest methods to estimate the heterogeneous
   treatment effects, aiming to provide a deeper understanding of how
   consumer decisions and behaviors are formed. The results highlighted
   that loss framing generally outperformed gain framing in encouraging the
   use of reusable cups. However, significant demographic variations
   emerged: younger adults (20s-30s) responded better to gain framing,
   while older adults (40s-60s) were more receptive to a loss framing. The
   impact of loss framing was particularly powerful among larger families
   and individuals who prioritize environmental concerns over inconvenience
   or have high social norms. These findings provide valuable empirical
   evidence for policymakers and businesses to develop targeted strategies
   that effectively promote sustainable consumer behavior while maintaining
   economic efficiency, ultimately contributing to both environmental
   sustainability and market optimization.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the initially successful transition from
   regional bottle reuse for mineral water to a widespread bottle reuse
   system in Germany, along with its subsequent destabilisation into a
   single-use recycling paradigm, and what this teaches us about tipping
   dynamics in packaging systems. Our aim is to understand how tipping
   happens, focusing on destabilising (of the previous system), tipping
   (towards the new system), and stabilising (of the new system) dynamics
   and the agency of business and policy to bring this about. Building on
   current research on positive tipping points (PTPs), our case study
   demonstrates opportunities to create an environment for change, the role
   of reinforcing feedback loops in accelerating sustainable transitions,
   and successful interventions. However, the case also demonstrates the
   threat of negative social tipping points: the destabilisation of newly
   created systems as a result of the emergence of competing technologies,
   in this case, single-use plastic bottles and recycling. Unsuccessful
   efforts to stop this included the introduction of a reusable plastic
   bottle and a failed policy intervention that rushed into a solution that
   instead accelerated the change it was designed to prevent. We close by
   examining what lessons can be learned from this historical case for
   current ongoing efforts to accelerate the transition towards a circular
   economy. Furthermore, based on our insights, we propose prescriptive
   steps based on the lens of positive tipping points to operationalise it
   to support the development of new solutions and interventions.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to analyse the spatial and temporal patterns of
   microplastic pollution and their correlation with tidal cycles in the
   Belawan Estuary. Microplastics were found in water samples collected
   during various lunar phases and tidal cycles, averaging 0.071 +/- 0.041
   particles m-3. This level of microplastic abundance is relatively low
   globally. The predominant microplastic type identified was fibres sized
   <1000 mu m. Spatially, higher microplastic concentrations were detected
   closer to the coastline, particularly during the high tide and full moon
   phases. These findings indicate that various physical and environmental
   factors influence the occurrence and accumulation of microplastics in
   the Belawan Estuary. Further investigation is necessary to examine the
   primary and secondary sources of microplastic pollution and to
   understand the effects of natural elements, such as water currents,
   wind, and river transport. Understanding these patterns is crucial for
   developing effective strategies to tackle microplastic contamination at
   national, regional, and global levels. This includes integrating waste
   management across all stakeholders, from national policymakers to local
   implementers, and encouraging individual responsibility to reduce the
   use of single-use plastics while promoting sustainable alternatives.
   Such efforts can help minimise the potential harm to marine ecosystems
   and human health.},

Volume = {63},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This dataset describes anthropogenic litter pollution, including plastic
   pollution, at nine sampling sites at lakes and the ocean in Nova Scotia
   in the fall of 2024. It comprises data from two different citizen
   science protocols. The first protocol ({''}Group A{''}) assessed litter
   density per m(2) and litter type (paper, cigarettes, plastic, metal,
   glass, food leftover, other). A total of 675 m(2) were investigated
   using this protocol, and a total of 495 litter items classified. The
   second protocol ({''}Group B{''}) assessed the litter item composition
   of individual items, based on 24 litter categories, including nine
   single-use plastics categories. In total 3032 litter items were
   collected and sorted into these categories, representing 114 kg of
   litter. In total, 20 sampling activities (Group A and B combined) were
   conducted at nine sampling sites. Potential sources of litter items were
   also evaluated, and each sampling site was described in detail,
   including coordinates, shape, slope and orientation of the shoreline and
   accessibility. The data were collected by 275 people from nine
   organizations, most of them citizen scientists. Collectively, they
   contributed 635 h of data collection effort, including litter
   collection, litter sorting and data annotation. Most of the citizen
   scientists were schoolchildren, aided in their research by their
   teachers and the coordinators of this project. The implementation of the
   project in Nova Scotia was part of the Plastic Pirates program
   (https://www.plastic-pirates.eu/), investigating litter pollution in
   different countries in cooperation with schoolchildren and teachers.

Title = {Biodegradable and smart packaging films for food quality and safety: A
   review},
Journal = {APPLIED FOOD RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Growing concerns over single-use plastic (SUP) waste, regulatory
   restrictions on non-recyclable materials, and the need for
   environmentally responsible solutions are accelerating the shift toward
   sustainable food packaging systems. Within the SUP category, packaging
   contributes approximately 40 \% of the global plastic waste burden,
   underscoring the urgent demand for bio-based, biodegradable
   alternatives. In this context, biodegradable and smart packaging films
   have gained considerable attention for their potential to reduce plastic
   pollution, extend the shelf life of perishable products, and preserve
   food safety and nutritional quality. This review provides an indepth
   overview of recent innovations in biodegradable films developed from
   renewable resources such as polysaccharides, proteins, lipids,
   polyesters, and microbial polymers. It focuses on their functional,
   mechanical, and barrier properties, as well as their integration into
   active and intelligent food packaging systems. Key fabrication
   techniques, such as casting, extrusion, and coating are discussed in
   relation to enhancing film performance. Recent advances in
   nanocomposites and multilayer systems are highlighted for their ability
   to overcome moisture sensitivity and gas barrier limitations.
   Furthermore, the incorporation of active agents and smart indicators has
   facilitated the development of intelligent packaging capable of
   real-time food quality monitoring. Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP)
   is also emphasized as a synergistic approach, where biodegradable films
   function alongside gas control and spoilage detection mechanisms to
   effectively extend product shelf life. The review also considers
   regulatory, safety, and end-of-life factors, and outlines strategies for
   scalable, sustainable implementation in the food packaging industry.},

   Decision Making as a Real-Life Study in Thailand},

Abstract = {Thailand generated 27.2 million tons of municipal solid waste in 2024,
   of which 12\% was plastic waste, predominantly single-use plastics. The
   mismanagement of plastic waste can lead to significant long-term
   environmental issues, including the release of toxic chemicals through
   open burning and air pollution, posing risks to human health. Effective
   and efficient plastic waste collection and recycling are therefore
   essential to address the reduction and management of plastic waste, as
   well as to support a low-carbon energy transition. This study assessed
   three community-driven initiatives by conducting a comparative
   sustainability assessment of plastic bag recycling under real-life
   conditions in Thailand using a multi-criteria decision-making framework.
   The results of the assessment in three municipalities showed that the
   actual collection rates in all initiatives remained extremely low
   (0.0014-0.1555\%). The highest rankings were observed with recycling
   initiatives driven by superior collection rates and favorable economic
   returns. The hindrances to promoting sustainability are found to be due
   to policy inconsistency, ineffective leadership, and behavioral
   barriers. The practical collection rates should increase to at least
   25\% to be more sustainable in terms of economic, social, and
   environmental aspects compared to those without the recycling
   initiative. These findings, thus, provide specific targets for improving
   plastic waste separation and management strategies in all regions facing
   similar challenges.},

Title = {Assessing macroplastic debris collected from eight diverse river systems
   across four continents: Insights from synchronous three-year
   community-led research efforts},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution is an urgent and growing threat to human and planetary
   health. Rivers transport large volumes of plastic pollution across and
   between Earth's systems, providing opportunistic and strategic focal
   points for collection and quantitative assessments of plastic debris. A
   dearth of empirical, in situ studies of riverine plastic debris in
   scientific literature highlights the need for more research conducted in
   rivers across diverse contexts to better understand riverine plastic
   debris and inform upstream solutions. We present and analyze a dataset
   on macroplastic debris collected over three years (2020-2023) in a
   nearly continuous and synchronous fashion from eight diverse river
   systems in eight countries across four continents. We observed the
   majority (66 \%) of the 3.8M kg of debris collected and analyzed in
   these river systems to be plastic. The compositions of polymers,
   single-use plastic items, and end-of-life fates of the collected plastic
   debris varied substantially between river systems. We discuss how
   differences in socioeconomic, regulatory, and infrastructure conditions
   across study sites begin to explain some of the observed variation. From
   these data insights, we share local and global recommendations for
   actions that could help reduce the flow of plastic debris into rivers in
   the first place. This research adds to our growing understanding of
   plastic pollution locally in these specific river systems as well as
   globally at a moment when the international community is actively
   working towards a global policy instrument to end plastic pollution.},

Title = {Including decision makers in development of cost-efficient litter
   monitoring - A three step process},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {373},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Environmental monitoring data to document levels and sources of
   macrolitter is important for decision makers to prevent and reduce
   amounts of this pollution. Here we suggest a structured process in
   developing national monitoring programs. Given limited resources for
   monitoring, we highlight the importance of including decision makers in
   prioritizing monitoring needs. The process involves 1) mapping
   international obligations and national needs, 2) evaluation of whether
   these are met by available monitoring data and, 3) assessment of
   nationally implemented and internationally recommended monitoring
   methods. Application of this approach when providing advice on a
   Norwegian monitoring program found that data needs are extensive:
   amounts, composition and sources of litter should be monitored across
   environmental compartments to understand entry points, transportation
   routes and litter loads. Monitoring of items targeted in the EU
   Single-Use Plastics (SUP) Directive is also needed. Data requirements in
   Norway are partly met in marine compartments through ongoing monitoring,
   but data collection is insufficient in time and space. Harmonized
   monitoring protocols are available, but knowledge on designing
   representative sampling strategies is lacking. Current monitoring does
   not meet needs for implementing the SUP Directive, nor to document
   impacts on biota and litter in non-marine compartments. To meet all
   needs and obligations, monitoring must be strengthened and extended to
   all environmental compartments using harmonized protocols with high
   technical readiness. Improved availability and use of data will allow
   feedback and secure policy relevance. To facilitate appropriate
   scientific advice when establishing national monitoring programs
   decision makers should be engaged in prioritization of monitoring needs.},

Title = {Sustainable healthcare practices: Pathways to a carbon-neutral future
   for the medical industry},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE FUTURES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The healthcare sector is essential for public health but contributes
   substantially to environmental pollution and carbon emissions, largely
   through energy-intensive operations, extensive waste generation, and
   resource-heavy pharmaceutical production. As climate change intensifies,
   there is a growing imperative for healthcare to adopt carbon-neutral
   practices that align with global sustainability goals. This narrative
   review explores the pathways through which healthcare can transition
   toward carbon neutrality, focusing on energy-efficient hospital designs,
   eco-friendly medical supplies, sustainable waste management, and
   low-carbon pharmaceutical manufacturing. Energy-efficient hospital
   design utilizes renewable energy, sustainable architecture, and
   AI-driven energy optimization to lower operational emissions.
   Environmentally sustainable medical supplies reduce single-use plastics
   by incorporating biodegradable and reusable materials, as well as
   sustainable procurement practices. Waste management strategies,
   including waste segregation, recycling, and energy recovery systems,
   help reduce healthcare's environmental footprint, while green chemistry
   and renewable energy integration in pharmaceutical manufacturing further
   mitigate emissions. Although financial, regulatory, and operational
   challenges remain, advances in green technology and increasing awareness
   provide new opportunities for healthcare organizations to adopt
   sustainable practices. By prioritizing both environmental responsibility
   and patient care, the healthcare sector can contribute significantly to
   global climate objectives. This review highlights the importance of
   collaboration, policy support, and investment in sustainable healthcare
   to ensure a resilient, low-carbon future.},

Title = {Paving the way for green endoscopy in Saudi Arabia: A call for
   sustainable gastroenterology practice},
Journal = {SAUDI JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 NOV 11},
Abstract = {Green endoscopy, the integration of environmentally sustainable
   practices into gastrointestinal endoscopy services, is gaining global
   momentum amid rising concerns about healthcare's carbon footprint.
   Endoscopy contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, medical
   waste, and energy consumption due to its reliance on single-use
   plastics, energy-intensive reprocessing, and high procedural volumes.
   International initiatives, including those by the British Society of
   Gastroenterology and European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy
   (ESGE), have highlighted strategies such as life cycle assessments,
   structured waste segregation, reusable devices, and carbon tracking, to
   reduce the environmental burden of endoscopy. While several high-income
   countries have adopted these approaches, Saudi Arabia has only begun to
   explore green endoscopy, despite its alignment with the sustainability
   objectives of Vision 2030 and the Saudi Green Initiative. Current
   barriers include lack of national guidelines, limited awareness among
   healthcare providers, inadequate recycling infrastructure, and infection
   control concerns. However, opportunities exist through centralized
   healthcare governance, investment in modern infrastructure, and
   integration of sustainability into training programs. This first of its
   kind review based on an extensive appraisal of existing literature
   examines the current status, challenges, and future opportunities for
   green endoscopy in Saudi Arabia, highlighting the urgent need for robust
   local data, supportive policy frameworks, and coordinated cross-sector
   collaboration. Embedding sustainability into endoscopy practice will not
   only reduce ecological impact but also position Saudi Arabia as a
   regional leader in sustainable healthcare.},

Title = {Plastic pollution in the Ganga river: sources, impacts, and sustainable
   mitigation strategies in the Himalayan regions},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 NOV 6},
Abstract = {The Ganga River, a critical lifeline for over 400 million people in
   South Asia, faces severe plastic pollution, with an estimated 0.6
   million tons of plastic waste entering its waters annually. This review
   comprehensively examines the dynamics of plastic pollution in the Ganga
   basin, focusing on the upper and lower Himalayan regions. It identifies
   key sources, including tourism-driven waste in the upper Himalayas and
   urban contributions (70\% of the plastic load) in the lower regions,
   alongside microplastic concentrations ranging from 40 to 100 particles
   per liter in tributaries like the Alaknanda and Song. Emerging
   contaminants such as phthalates (10-15 mu g/L), heavy metals (lead: 5-10
   mu g/g), and microbial pathogens (E. coli: 10(5) CFU/cm(2)) exacerbate
   ecological risks, with 60\% of fish species ingesting microplastics and
   the Gangetic dolphin experiencing a 25\% population decline over the
   past decade. Human health impacts include a 10\% higher incidence of
   reproductive issues and over 5000 annual waterborne disease cases, while
   socioeconomic consequences involve a 20\% fisheries decline and \$10
   million annual cleanup costs in cities like Kanpur. Challenges in
   assessment, such as inconsistent microplastic sampling and low waste
   treatment rates (30\%), are compounded by weak regulatory enforcement
   (20\% compliance). The review proposes integrated mitigation strategies,
   including policy reforms like strengthening India's 2022 single-use
   plastic ban (targeting 50\% waste reduction by 2025), research
   priorities such as standardizing microplastic protocols, and sustainable
   practices like biodegradable plastics (60\% reduction potential) and
   waste-to-energy systems (80\% efficiency). These recommendations aim to
   ensure the Ganga's long-term sustainability, offering a model for
   addressing plastic pollution in other river systems globally.},

Abstract = {The increase in global production of plastics has led to widespread
   environmental pollution, with mangrove ecosystems becoming significant
   traps for both macro- and microplastics. This study investigated plastic
   pollution in the mangrove forest of Gazi Bay, Kenya, focusing on the
   spatial distribution, types and sources of plastic debris. Macroplastic
   and large microplastic (LMPs; 1-5 mm) samples were collected from
   different zones in the mangroves and adjacent beach areas. The average
   concentration of plastic debris on the forest floor was 0.79 +/- 0.35
   items m-2, with an additional 0.17 +/- 0.04 items tree-1 entangled in
   the trees. Fishing-related plastics, such as ropes and fishnets, were
   prevalent in the seaward zones, while domestic waste was more common in
   the landward zones. LMPs were primarily concentrated in the landward
   zone and beach areas. Landward transects showed the highest average
   concentrations (1.25 +/- 0.66 LMPs kg-1 dry sand), while the beach zone
   had the largest proportion of polluted samples, with 25.93\% of
   replicates containing LMPs. A social survey in Gazi village revealed
   ongoing waste management challenges, with 55\% of residents admitting to
   littering despite Kenya's 2017 ban to reduce the use of single-use
   plastics. While the ban has had some positive effects, compliance
   remains difficult due to economic constraints and limited waste
   management. Respondents expressed willingness to reduce plastic use,
   indicating that policy enforcement must be combined with
   community-driven solutions. The findings emphasise the need for
   integrated waste management strategies, public engagement and improved
   infrastructure to mitigate plastic pollution in Kenyan mangrove
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Concern has spread worldwide because of the rising environmental impact
   and difficulties of sustainable development associated with traditional
   packaging. The ecology is seriously harmed by the increasing abandonment
   volumes of non-eco-friendly packaging waste due to the widespread use of
   conventional express packaging. One potential solution to mitigate
   pollution is substituting single-use plastic bags (SPDBs) with
   cellulose-based alternatives. When untreated, cellulose-based bags are
   limited in some applications by their potentially relatively low
   mechanical strength and hydrophilic nature, which affects their
   widespread use as packaging materials. Considering the humid environment
   that seeds may encounter during storage and transportation, this study
   designed a new packaging material with excellent hydrophobicity by
   chemically modifying cellulose with dopamine (DA) and
   dodecyltrimethoxysilane (DTMS) to prepare hydrophobically modified
   cellulose-based films (PDC). This produced PDC films exhibited high
   hydrophobicity, self-cleaning ability, better water barrier properties,
   and robust strength (increased by 134.7\% compared to cellulose film),
   which showed better water repellency and tensile strength than several
   commercially available plastics. The possible hydrophobic and tensile
   strengthening mechanisms were proposed. Ultimately, mung bean storage
   trials proved the viability of using PDC film for seed express packing,
   and the film satisfies express packaging standards by being recyclable
   or biodegradable after usage.},

Abstract = {Petroleum-based plastics are lightweight and durable and exhibit
   excellent formability. However, the increase in global plastics
   production, coupled with the economic development of emerging countries,
   and the resulting marine pollution caused by plastic waste have become
   serious problems in recent years. Polysaccharides, such as starch and
   cellulose, are the most abundant biopolymers in nature and are
   particularly promising plastic alternatives owing to their renewability,
   sustainability, and biodegradability. However, owing to their lack of
   water resistance and adequate mechanical properties, large-scale
   application of polysaccharide films in single-use plastics is limited
   because water resistance is preferred in many daily scenarios. Further
   research is required to optimize bioplastics to make them economically
   and practically feasible. In this report, we focus on stimuli-responsive
   materials that form or dissociate cross-linked structures in response to
   slight changes in external stimuli or the environment. We developed
   starch-based films with different disintegration/dissolution rates in
   freshwater and seawater as environmentally friendly materials. Modified
   starch was mixed with oxidized cellulose or a water-soluble polymer to
   prepare a transparent, homogeneous film. After the introduction of
   hydrogen bonds, the starch complex film was stable in freshwater;
   however, in seawater, the hydrogen bond crosslinks dissociated, causing
   the film to dissolve rapidly. This technology balances degradability in
   marine environments with water resistance in everyday environments,
   providing an alternative means of reducing marine plastic pollution, and
   it is expected to be applied in a variety of industrial sectors.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastic packaging has become a serious problem for many
   countries, including Canada, with millions of tons consumed annually
   without considering end-of-life impact. Researchers are developing
   sustainable alternatives to non-biodegradable plastic. While cellulose
   microfibers (MFC) and nanocrystalline cellulose (NFC) are common raw
   materials for film production, their preparation requires costly
   chemical treatments that cause environmental pollution. Kruger Inc.
   developed a method to produce cellulose filaments (CFs) with high
   fibrillation using only mechanical treatment. This study uses CFs to
   produce packaging films through handsheet forming, with cationic starch
   (CS) and Alkylketene Dimer (AKD) as additives for enhanced water, water
   vapor, and oxygen resistance. We analyzed morphological, barrier,
   mechanical, and optical properties using various techniques, including
   SEM, WVTR, WVP, OTR, contact angle, Cobb 60, burst index, tensile index,
   tear index, and transmittance. The films showed promising properties,
   with WVTR decreasing to 49.42 g/m2 \& sdot;day, WVP to 2.82 x 10-6 g \&
   sdot;m/m2 \& sdot;day \& sdot;Pa, OTR to 3.3 cc/m2 \& sdot;day, and Cobb
   value to 32.2 g/m2. After adding 3 \% CS, films demonstrated good
   mechanical performance with a tensile index of 80.49 N \& sdot;m/g,
   burst index of 10.93 kPa \& sdot;m2/g, and tear index of 0.66 mN \&
   sdot;m2/g. These results prove CFs' effectiveness with CS and AKD in
   forming films with excellent properties. CFs show potential compared to
   other biopolymers due to their eco-friendliness and costeffectiveness.
   The production method is simple, scalable, and yields biodegradable
   films composed of biomass-derived materials.},

Title = {Plastic waste reduction through catalyzing motivational factors:
   Implications for sustainable development goals in emerging economies},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE FUTURES},
Year = {2025},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution is increasingly recognized as a global crisis, driven
   by excessive production, consumption, and careless disposal of plastic
   materials. As plastic pollution endangers the environment, animal life,
   and human health, global awareness is growing. Unanticipated growth in
   plastic waste poses a grave threat to emerging economies. Hence, all
   members of the plastic value chain are required to contribute to the
   reduction of plastic waste. Therefore, this study aims to identify and
   analyze the motivational factors influencing stakeholders' decisions to
   decrease their plastic consumption in emerging economies. Utilizing a
   combination of Single-Valued Neutrosophic (SVN) approaches and the
   Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method, the
   most crucial factors are identified. The finding shows that, ``internal
   motivators{''} is the most important context and in this context,
   ``pressure from investors and shareholders for manufacturing sustainable
   products{''} and ``demoralizing single-use plastic{''} are the most
   influential motivational factors for reducing plastic waste. The
   findings have implications for consumers, businesses, and policymakers.
   Through an awareness of these motivating factors, stakeholders can put
   specific initiatives into place to encourage a sustainable culture and
   reduce the detrimental impacts of plastic pollution on the environment
   and society. Overall, this study offers a thorough framework for dealing
   with plastic waste in emerging economies, directing future efforts
   towards practical solutions.},

Title = {Development of smart edible spoons with pH-sensitive halochromic
   properties from kodo millet starch reinforced with Clitoria
   ternatea anthocyanins},

Abstract = {The increasing environmental burden of single-use plastic cutlery
   necessitates the development of sustainable, functional, and
   biodegradable alternatives to this material. In this study, pH-sensitive
   smart edible spoons were fabricated from kodo millet (Paspalum
   scrobiculatum) starch and xanthan gum (KD/XG) reinforced with Clitoria
   ternatea anthocyanins (butterfly pea extract, BPE). The effect of BPE
   incorporation (3-9 \%) on the structural, functional, and intelligent
   properties of the spoons was systematically investigated. FTIR and XRD
   analyses revealed hydrogen bonding interactions between anthocyanins and
   the KD/XG matrix, accompanied by a reduction in crystallinity. Thermal
   analysis indicated improved stability, with the onset of degradation
   shifting from 257 degrees C (control) to 275 degrees C (9 \% BPE).
   Antioxidant assays showed a dose-dependent increase in DPPH radical
   scavenging activity from 28.6 \% (control) to 45.3 \% (9 \% BPE). The
   spoons exhibited distinct and reversible pH-dependent color transitions
   (violet -> blue -> green, pH 3-10), enabling visual monitoring of food
   freshness. Microbial counts decreased below 5 log CFU/g after 30 days of
   storage, and soil burial tests confirmed complete biodegradation within
   20-30 days. Sensory evaluation identified 6 \% BPE as the optimal
   formulation, balancing mechanical strength, appearance, and consumer
   acceptability. Overall, this work demonstrates the synergistic role of
   millet starch, xanthan gum, and anthocyanins in developing edible,
   pH-responsive spoons that combine durability, antioxidant protection,
   and real-time freshness indication, representing a significant step
   toward intelligent biodegradable food packaging.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastic packaging has become a highly relevant topic
   worldwide, posing a challenge to the world's largest Fast-Moving
   Consumer Goods companies, given the negative perception of consumers
   about plastics and their environmental and health impacts. Also, the
   recent focus of EU-wide legislation and strategies towards more
   sustainable and circular solutions has increased the pressure on these
   companies. One of the strategies outlined is that, by 2030, all
   Single-use packaging placed on the European market is reusable or
   recyclable, driving design for re-use and recyclability of packaging.
   The reuse strategy is gaining a significant boost in the packaging
   world, evidenced by the commitments, research, creation of startups and
   pilot tests launched over recent years. This interest stems from the
   growing recognition that Reusable Packaging has the potential to
   generate environmental benefits, being considered one of the most
   environmentally friendly options. This paper aims to identify design
   opportunities to develop an innovative and efficient reusable food
   packaging system that incorporates the principles of the Circular
   Economy, analysing the macroeconomic environment, identifying and
   analysing existing reuse solutions, and understanding consumers' needs
   and desires. Key requirements include convenient, safe, and durable
   packaging, effective reduction in ecological footprint, efficient
   cleaning systems, consumer-friendly infrastructure, and population
   density to sustain the business. It is also crucial that the packaging
   aligns with the food's characteristics, as both are interdependent. The
   study provides insights for designers and the industry eager to create
   new business opportunities related to innovative and effective reusable
   food packaging systems.},

Abstract = {Sustainable technologies have enabled the production of degradable
   single-use plastics (SUPs) for various applications. However,
   environmentally friendly, porous disposable absorbents still lack the
   competitive functionality of synthetic options. In this work, we report
   the continuous extrusion of fully biopolymer-based porous absorbents
   derived from integrated proteins and lignocellulosic residues, all
   sourced from biomass waste. The results show that the saline absorption
   capacity of the extruded materials increases 1.5 times compared to the
   reference solely by including oat husk, a lignocellulosic byproduct from
   the food industry. The absorption was further improved 2 times by
   including a delignification step on the oat husk and wheat bran,
   demonstrating the importance of the biomass's chemistry in increasing
   the material's absorption. Here, the addition of 20 wt \% of Keratin
   fibers from food waste increases the material's absorbency to 6.5 g/g,
   with the ability to retain 2 g/g of the saline solution in its
   structure, which is also the highest reported value for extruded
   protein-based formulations so far. This work advances the development of
   porous absorbent materials with competitive performance, utilizing
   industrial methods and upcycling undervalued biomass waste into
   sustainable consumer products. Introducing porous biopolymer-based
   materials as alternatives to synthetic counterparts used in the hygiene
   and sanitary industries ensures the return of safe molecules to nature,
   paving the way for microplastic-free, single-use, porous absorbents.},

Title = {Development of Biodegradable Foam Trays from Brewer's Malt Bagasse and
   Potato Residues from Agricultural Crops},

Abstract = {In light of the environmental impact of disposable products made from
   petroleum-based plastics, this study focused on developing biodegradable
   foam trays made from a starch (PS) derived from potato waste and beer
   malt flour (BMBF). The objective of this study was to evaluate the
   effect of the concentration of BMBF on the physical and mechanical
   properties of potato starch-based foam trays prepared by the
   thermoforming process at temperatures of 150 degrees C (upper plate) and
   145 degrees C (lower plate) for 5 min and 40 s. The results showed that
   increasing the BMBF concentration from 0 to 40\% reduced the moisture
   content from 4.68\% to 3.42\%, increased the thickness from 2.63 cm to
   4.77 cm, and decreased the density from 0.28 g.cm(-3) to 0.15 g.cm(-3).
   Meanwhile, the water absorption capacity increased from 38.7\% to
   69.7\%. In terms of mechanical properties, increasing the BMBF
   concentration in the PS foam tray resulted in a decrease in hardness
   from 5.61 N to 2.87 N, a decrease in tensile strength from 2.92 MPa to
   0.85 MPa, and a decrease in elongation from 1.42\% to 0.59\%. Meanwhile,
   fracturability increased from 2.04 mm to 3.68 mm. FTIR analysis revealed
   interactions between BMBF and PS in the composite foam tray.
   Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed two thermal events: one between
   20.96 degrees C and 172.89 degrees C, and another between 189.14 degrees
   C and 517.69 degrees C, with weight losses of 5.53\% and 74.23\%,
   leaving an ash residue of 20.24\%. Differential calorimetry analysis
   (DSC) showed a glass transition at 152.88 degrees C and a melting at
   185.94 degrees C, with an enthalpy of fusion of 74.11 J.g(-1). Higher
   concentrations of BMBF (>10\%) decreased the water resistance,
   mechanical strength, and flexibility of the PS foam trays. Therefore, a
   formulation of 90\% PS and 10\% BMBF was better for producing a foam
   tray with improved mechanical properties and water resistance, which
   could be used as a sustainable alternative to conventional single-use
   plastic.},

Title = {Sustainable Solutions for Eye Drop Plastic Waste: Challenges,
   Innovations, and Environmental Impact},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {2025},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The widespread use of single-use plastic eye drop bottles in
   ophthalmology presents a significant environmental challenge. While
   essential for preventing contamination and ensuring patient safety,
   these bottles contribute to plastic waste due to their small size,
   multimaterial composition, and inadequate recycling infrastructure. This
   review examines the environmental impact of eye drop packaging across
   various ophthalmic conditions, including dry eye disease, cataract
   surgery, and glaucoma, highlighting the substantial cumulative burden of
   plastic waste and carbon emissions. The manuscript explores innovative
   solutions to mitigate this environmental footprint without compromising
   clinical standards. Key strategies discussed include product redesign
   using biodegradable materials, the adoption of multidose
   preservative-free systems, and the development of alternative drug
   delivery technologies like punctal plugs. Additionally, the importance
   of advanced recycling initiatives, such as specialized take-back
   programs, is emphasized. The paper also underscores the need for
   behavioral, institutional, and policy interventions, including
   educational campaigns, sustainable procurement practices, and the
   implementation of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policies. By
   integrating these multifaceted approaches, the field of ophthalmology

Title = {Estimating the accumulation and re-accumulation of commercial tobacco,
   electronic cigarette, and cannabis waste based on a stratified random
   sample of census blocks},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {We investigated the amount and distribution of waste generated by
   commercial tobacco, electronic cigarette, and cannabis (TEC) use to
   inform policy options aimed at mitigating the environmental harm caused
   by these products. Using disproportionate stratified random sampling, we
   selected 60 census blocks from the eight largest cities in San Diego
   County, California. We twice surveyed publicly accessible areas in these
   blocks to quantify TEC waste accumulation and its re-accumulation. All
   collected items were photographed, classified, geocoded, counted, and
   properly discarded. We identified demographic, land use, and behavioral
   data from public sources and direct observations. We modeled total
   cigarette butt quantities for all census blocks across the eight cities
   and found similar results for Round 1 (8.63 million) and Round 2 (8.66
   million) collections. Single-use plastic cigarette filters were the
   primary contributor to TEC waste (94\%). Total TEC waste counts and
   cigarette butt counts showed strong linear associations (r = +0.86 and r
   = +0.91). The area surveyed, land use category, resident demographics,
   smoking prevalence, and walkability explained 78\% of the variance in
   cigarette butt count. The interval between Round 1 and 2 counts did not
   affect re-accumulation counts, suggesting that baseline TEC waste levels
   were re-established within 1-2 months after cleanup. Annually, we
   estimate up to 200 million cellulose acetate plastic filters may be
   discarded in public areas of the eight cities. Given the continuous
   deposition, vast quantity, heterogeneous distribution, and rapid
   re-accumulation of TEC waste after cleanup, increasing removal efforts
   alone are financially untenable and impractical downstream solutions for
   TEC waste. Community-wide policies (e.g., filter bans, outdoor smoking
   restrictions) and individual behavior changes (e.g., reduced smoking
   rates, proper disposal of cigarette butts) are necessary to effectively
   mitigate the environmental impact of TEC waste in urban settings.},

Title = {Mapping the Distribution and Discharge of Plastic Pollution in the Ganga
   River},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},
Number = {11},
Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {The Ganga River, a lifeline for millions and a critical freshwater
   ecosystem, is under threat from escalating plastic pollution driven by
   widespread usage and inadequate disposal practices. While marine
   ecosystems have garnered extensive research attention, freshwater
   systems-particularly in the Global South-remain underexplored, leaving
   critical gaps in understanding plastic pollution's sources and pathways.
   Addressing these gaps, the study documents the prevalence and typology
   of plastic debris in urban and underexplored rural communities along the
   Ganga River, India, aiming to suggest mechanisms for a reduction in
   source-based pollution. A stratified random sampling approach was used
   to select survey sites and plastic debris was quantified and categorised
   through transect surveys. A total of 37,730 debris items were retrieved,
   dominated by packaging debris (52.46\%), fragments (23.38\%),
   tobacco-related debris (5.03\%), and disposables (single-use plastic
   cutleries) (4.73\%) along the surveyed segments with varying abundance
   trends. Floodplains displayed litter densities nearly 28 times higher
   than river shorelines (6.95 items/m2 vs. 0.25 items/m2), with minor
   variations between high- and low-population-density areas (7.14 items/m
   vs. 6.7 items/m2). No significant difference was found between rural and
   urban areas (V = 41, p = 0.19), with mean densities of 0.87 items/m2 and
   0.81 items/m2, respectively. Seasonal variations were insignificant (V =
   13, p = 0.30), but treatment sites displayed significant variance (Chi2
   = 10.667, p = 0.004) due to flood impacts. The findings underscore the
   urgent need for tailored waste management strategies integrating
   industrial reforms, decentralised governance, and community-driven
   efforts. Enhanced baseline information and coordinated multi-sectoral
   efforts, including Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), are crucial
   for mitigating plastic pollution and protecting freshwater ecosystems,
   given rivers' significant contribution to ocean pollution.},

Title = {Multidimensional risk assessment of marine litter pollution in the
   ecologically fragile coral atolls of India},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {Marine litter (ML), predominantly plastic, threatens oceanic
   biodiversity and ecosystem functioning globally. However, limited
   knowledge exists about its impact on India's coastal areas, particularly
   the Lakshadweep Islands, the nation's sole coral atolls. Within this
   frame of reference, the present study comprehensively investigated the
   distribution, abundance, typology, and ecological risks associated with
   ML across 28 beaches and three lagoon reef stations on Kavaratti Island.
   A total of 32,710 litter items, divided into 11 categories, were found
   with an average litter density of 0.82 +/- 0.80 items/m2. Plastic litter
   emerged as the most prevalent category across the study area,
   constituting 63.7\% of the total, and public littering was identified as
   the primary source (43\%). Assessments of environmental quality and
   ecological risk, employing indices like the Clean Coast Index (CCI),
   Plastic Abundance Index (PAI), Hazardous Litter Index (HLI), Pollution
   Load Index (PLI), and Environmental Status Index (ESI), identified the
   Lakshadweep coastline as being at risk due to litter pollution and
   hazardous litter abundance. The mean concentration of trapped litter on
   the coral reef was estimated at 1.73 +/- 0.46 items/m2, with a PLI value
   of 53.4, indicating an alarming ecological risk and highly perilous
   condition for the lagoon reef ecosystem. Approximately 5.94\% +/- 0.18\%
   of coral colonies, particularly of the Porites genus, were found in
   contact with ML, with a significant proportion displaying signs of
   disease and tissue loss (59.37\%), and partial bleaching or pale
   (14.86\%). The results highlight the growing threat of litter to beach
   and coral communities, emphasizing the urgent need for effective
   regional litter management, strengthened policies for banning and
   phasing out single-use plastics in Lakshadweep, and efficient
   transportation of non-biodegradable waste to authorized recyclers on the
   mainland.},

Title = {Extended Sector Responsibility-The Tourism Sector as a Driver for
   Improved Waste Management in Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia},
Journal = {RECYCLING},

Abstract = {The world is facing climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution,
   significantly impacting lower-middle-income countries like Egypt,
   Morocco, and Tunisia, which depend heavily on tourism. Poor waste
   management, unclear responsibilities, and weak policies contribute to
   environmental degradation. Tourism, a key economic driver, also
   increases the problem by high plastic use and waste generation during
   peak seasons. This study evaluates current waste management practices in
   Alexandria (Egypt), Essaouira (Morocco), and Hammam Sousse (Tunisia) and
   proposes improvements using a newly developed ``Extended Sector
   Responsibility{''} (ESR) model, which introduces an innovative
   organizational approach to waste management in touristic destinations.
   Using a combination of desk research, questionnaires, waste sorting
   analyses, and expert interviews, our research identifies systemic
   deficiencies. None of the studied locations have formal source
   separation systems, and waste management heavily depends on the informal
   sector. Hotels exhibit limited capacity for effective waste practices
   due to the lack of municipal infrastructure for separate collection.
   Economic analysis of the ESR model, which involves the establishment of
   a new waste recovery facility, demonstrates that while such facilities
   can generate revenue exceeding operational costs under specific
   scenarios, their long-term viability hinges on additional funding,
   possibly through Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) mechanisms.
   Although Egypt and Tunisia have EPR legislation, implementation remains
   inadequate, and Morocco lacks such frameworks. The study emphasizes the
   critical need for investments in municipal waste management
   infrastructure, including logistics, sorting, and recycling systems. It
   also highlights actionable opportunities for the tourism sector to
   reduce waste by minimizing single-use plastics and food waste. By
   adopting the ESR model, the tourism sector can play a pivotal role in
   transitioning to a circular economy, ultimately mitigating environmental
   impacts and enhancing sustainability in the region.},

Abstract = {Plastics have become an integral part of modern life, driving global
   production to a new level and contributing to widespread environmental
   pollution due to inadequate recycling and waste management systems. The
   COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this crisis by increasing the use of
   single-use plastics, countering earlier attempts to reduce plastic use.
   A critical concern with plastic pollution is its progressive degradation
   into microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs), which can disperse
   through air, water, and soil and reach every part of ecosystems. The
   application of sewage sludge, the breakdown of plastic mulch, and
   wastewater irrigation have made agricultural soils into important MP
   sinks, with grave consequences for soil health and food safety. MPs and
   NPs in particular present significant concerns because of their tiny
   size, high mobility, and capacity to interact with pollutants in the
   soil, enter plant tissues, and interfere with metabolic, physiological,
   and biochemical processes. Recent studies have highlighted their uptake
   in diverse crops, demonstrating oxidative stress, impaired growth, and
   significant metabolic reprogramming. This review critically examines the
   pathways of microplastic uptake and transport in plants, resulting in
   physiological and biochemical alterations, and the underlying metabolic
   responses. Microplastics are found to interfere with soil microbes and
   nutrient cycling, as well as plant metabolism. It is essential to
   comprehend these changes using multi-omics techniques in order to create
   resilient crops and successful mitigation plans. By identifying current
   knowledge gaps, it outlines future research directions to deepen our
   understanding of plant-microplastic interactions and their broader
   consequences for agriculture and ecosystem sustainability.},

Abstract = {In this study, the influence of anthropogenic pressures, namely fishing
   practices and illicit and unregulated wastewater and solid waste
   discharge, on the microplastic distribution in India's Kallada River -
   Ashtamudi riverine-estuarine environment was investigated. To better
   characterize microplastic pollution in the Estuary, it was subdivided
   into cage farming, open fishing, solid waste dumping, and other zones
   that receive wastewater from residential areas. A source-apportioning
   approach was utilized to delineate the possible sources of pollution and
   conducted a risk assessment attributed to exposure to microplastic
   pollution. The results suggest that the solid waste dumping zone
   exhibited the highest microplastic abundance, followed by the cage
   farming zone. Fiber-shaped microplastic particles were abundant in cage
   farming and open fishing zones, while films dominated the solid waste
   dumping zone. FTIR analysis revealed that polyamide and polyester,
   widely used for regional fishing nets, were dominant in cage farming and
   open fishing zones, while polyamide, polystyrene, and polyethylene were
   dominant in solid waste dumping zones. Other zones impacted by the
   unregulated discharge of domestic wastewater exhibited an abundance of
   polyester and polyethylene microplastics. Source apportionment studies
   using a modified approach incorporating morphological and chemical
   characteristics of microplastics revealed that fishing nets/ropes
   contributed to 35.48 \% of microplastic pollution, followed by
   single-use plastics and plastic bags/covers (19.35 \% each), textile
   fabrics (16.13 \%) and personal care products (9.68 \%). A risk
   assessment analysis considering microplastic abundance and polymer
   hazard revealed that the solid waste dumping zone and the cage farming
   zone pose a medium risk to microplastic pollution. These findings
   highlight the role of fishing practices and solid waste dumping on the
   microplastic pollution in the riverine-estuarine environment.},

Abstract = {Plastic pollution is increasingly affecting the South Pacific, including
   remote islands and coastal regions of Small Island Developing States
   (SIDS), yet data remain sparse in many areas. This baseline study
   presents original data on beach macrolitter and microplastics in surface
   waters and sediments across six islands of French Polynesia (Moorea,
   Bora Bora, Tahaa) and the Cook Islands (Aitutaki, Rarotonga), collected
   during a cruise in 2024. Beach surveys revealed high plastic
   contamination on most sites, with macroplastics (size >2.5 cm) densities
   ranging from 18 to 58 items/100 m, exceeding European threshold values
   (e.g. 22 items/100 m) on majority of sampled beaches. Single-use
   plastics and plastic fragments dominated litter, with local sources such
   as tourism and coastal activities clearly identifiable. Surface
   microplastics (315 mu m-5 mm) were found at low densities, ranging from
   0 to 4668 particles/km(2), confirming relatively low contamination in
   surface waters. Only 17 particles were detected from 8 manta net tows.
   Sediment and beach microplastic analysis yielded very limited results,
   with microplastics found at only two sites (Huahine and Rarotonga),
   dominated by fragments and colored fibers. These results suggest
   localized contamination linked to urbanization and tourism rather than
   widespread oceanic inputs. Despite methodological limitations due to the
   cruise format, this study contributes rare data from under-sampled
   regions, supporting long-term monitoring efforts and informing future
   policy and mitigation actions. The results underline the need to improve
   regional waste management, which will be beneficial for local societies
   largely based on tourism.},

Title = {Plastic waste in the East African Community (EAC): status, discharge,
   contamination, and mitigation strategies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ADVANCES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {20},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The East African Community (EAC) is a regional intergovernmental
   organization comprising seven partner states: Burundi, the Democratic
   Republic of Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. EAC
   has a rapid urbanization, population growth, and increasing plastic
   consumption. Despite policy efforts and bans on single-use plastics in
   some member states, inadequate waste management and limited recycling
   initiatives hinder effective plastic waste reduction. Although plastic
   waste and microplastics pose significant pose significant concerning
   risks, there is currently no comprehensive review detailing their
   prevalence, mitigation strategies, and health impact within EAC. This
   review explores the status and gaps regarding plastic waste in EAC
   countries, its discharge to the ocean, and microplastic contamination in
   EAC water bodies. It highlights the existing mitigation strategies to
   address plastic waste. Furthermore, suggestions for controlling and
   mitigating plastic waste are delineated, outlining both conceptual
   aspects and practical approaches. Strengthening regional cooperation,
   improving waste management systems, and promoting sustainable
   alternatives are crucial for tackling plastic waste. Through educational
   outreach and campaigns, coupled with the development of non-toxic
   plastic alternatives and the implementation of effective disposal or
   recycling strategies, can yield numerous advantages for the use of
   plastic materials in everyday human life, given their affordability and
   versatility. Further investigations are needed to detect microplastics
   and nanoplastics in water bodies across the EAC, as existing research
   remains limited.},

Title = {Studies on poly(butylene succinate) and poly(butylene
   succinate-co-adipate)-based biodegradable plastics for
   sustainable flexible packaging and agricultural applications: a
   comprehensive review},
Journal = {RSC SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2025},

Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {Due to the increasing use of single-use plastics in daily life, plastic
   trash is expanding annually, destroying our ecology and producing an
   unparalleled waste disposal crisis. Bioplastics like poly(butylene
   succinate) (PBS) and poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA) can
   substitute certain non-biodegradable polymer materials and can
   effectively biodegrade under predefined environmental conditions. Both
   PBS and PBSA were traditionally synthesized from petroleum resources,
   but in recent years, PBS and PBSA have been reported to be produced from
   a hybrid of petroleum and renewable resources. PBS and PBSA polymers
   have good ductility and strength, but their high production costs and
   limited production volume limit their widespread packaging usage.
   Therefore, they are usually blended with other polymers and fillers to
   improve processability, mechanical properties, and biodegradability.
   Thus, recent polymer processing advances have made these
   blends/composites an appealing material platform for packaging and
   agricultural applications with composting compliance. Despite this, few
   studies have investigated the application of these polymers in real food
   packaging uses and in agricultural applications, thus highlighting a
   research gap. Nevertheless, PBS and PBSA-based commercial items are
   currently on the market, with examples including flexible packaging
   materials, compostable cutlery, and disposable tableware. Therefore, the
   purpose of this article is to provide an overview of research trends on
   PBS and PBSA, including the sustainability of their green synthesis
   routes using LCA studies, their biodegradability, applications in food
   packaging and agriculture, and end-of-life considerations. This study
   aligns with the United Nations' sustainability goal of responsible
   consumption and production (Sustainable Development Goal 12).},

Abstract = {This research explores Portuguese consumer behavior in the consumption
   of non-prepacked foods, in a context of growing environmental concerns
   and the negative impacts of plastic pollution and greenhouse gas
   emissions associated with single-use plastic packaging. As the global
   food system faces scrutiny for its contribution to environmental
   degradation, packaging-free retail emerges as a promising solution to
   mitigate packaging waste and promote sustainable consumption practices.
   However, despite its potential benefits, barriers such as unfamiliarity,
   inconvenient shopping experiences and logistical challenges prevent
   widespread adoption. To this extent, this study aimed to evaluate the
   state of change in relation to the purchase of non-prepacked foods in
   the Portuguese population, as well as the underlying preferences that
   drive their consumption. 514 individuals (393 females and 121 males, and
   1 participant who preferred not to disclose their gender) aged between
   18-65 years old participated in this study. The subjects completed a
   translated and adapted version of the ``States of Change{''}
   questionnaire.
   Analysis of the results revealed that a significant proportion of
   individuals already consume non-prepacked food, as a lifestyle choice,
   presenting a clear opportunity for the development of innovative
   solutions tailored to thismarket segment. However, barriers persist,
   highlighting the need for targeted interventions to encourage
   sustainable consumption behaviors, particularly among younger people and
   individuals resistant to change. This study seeks to contribute to the
   alignment of design and innovation strategieswith the needs of consumers
   in this market segment.},

Abstract = {Central venous catheter (CVC) line insertion packs contain single-use
   plastic and metal items that are disposed of after the pack is opened,
   regardless of whether the item was used. This study aimed to collect
   data on the experiences and views of Australian clinicians who use CVC
   line insertion packs in paediatric critical care, elicit possible
   solutions to reduce waste associated with these packs, and to estimate
   the potential for financial and carbon footprint savings from a refined
   pack. This study was performed in two large paediatric tertiary referral
   hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Clinicians were invited to a survey and
   an interview to determine if and what items from a CVC line insertion
   pack could be excluded. Outcome measures included financial costs and
   embodied carbon emissions (CO2e). Of approximately 200 eligible
   clinicians who were invited, 25 (12.5\%) completed the survey and 18
   (9\%) were interviewed (five did both). All survey respondents were
   willing to use a new pack that had less waste. They identified five
   items within the existing CVC pack as commonly non-essential. Interview
   data identified additional strategies for waste minimisation, including
   use of a trolley that allowed choice of items to use. Many clinicians
   expressed moral distress concerning healthcare's impact on the
   environment. We calculated that a refined CVC pack without these five
   items would save the two participating hospitals approximately A\$1400
   and 230 kg CO2e per year. Financial and carbon savings may be achieved
   through removing items that are infrequently used and/or through use of
   a trolley.},

Title = {Repurposed plastic waste as a sustainable aggregate in bituminous
   mixtures},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {492},
Month = {SEP 19},
Abstract = {In bituminous mixtures, aggregate constitutes nearly 95 \% of the
   material by weight. However, the growing demand for aggregate due to
   extensive construction activities has led to a scarcity of natural
   resources, necessitating sustainable alternatives that maintain
   performance while preserving the environment. This study explores the
   possibility of using artificial aggregate (AA) moulded from repurposed
   plastic waste, consisting of LowDensity Polyethylene (LDPE),
   High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), and
   other single use plastic to partially replace granite aggregate in the
   design of bituminous mixtures. The Marshall specimens were prepared by
   replacing 2.5 \%, 5.0 \%, 7.5 \%, and 10 \% of granite aggregate with AA
   by weight. The results indicated that only the mixtures containing 0 \%,
   2.5 \%, and 5.0 \% AA met all volumetric and strength requirements.
   Thereby, the mixture performance studies were restricted to these
   mixtures only. The Hamburg Wheel Tracking Test results showed that 2.5
   \% and 5.0 \% AA mixtures exhibited 12 \% and 24 \% lower rut depths
   respectively than 0 \% AA. Mixtures with AA showed higher fatigue life
   than conventional mixtures at both mixture as well as binder scale.
   Morphological analysis performed using microscopic measurements verified
   the structural integrity of AA mixtures while leaching studies confirmed
   the environmental safety of bitumen-coated AA. The study concluded that
   2.5 \% AA can effectively replace granite aggregate in highway pavements
   with heavy traffic, while 5.0 \% AA is suitable for use on city roads,
   offering a sustainable solution for plastic waste disposal.},

   Reserve: Risk assessment and management strategies},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Worldwide, plastic pollution constitutes a significant environmental
   issue, currently recognized as a major threat to marine biodiversity.
   Enhancing our knowledge of the pathway of plastic accumulation in a
   particular site is crucial for litter management. Hence this study aimed
   to examine macro, meso, and microplastics (MPs) for their abundance and
   characterization along the beaches of Dhanushkodi, Kundukal, Pudumadam,
   and Valangapuri in the Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve Region, Southern
   India towards suggesting possible management solution. A total of 1083
   numbers, 58 kg of macro litter found in 2464 m2. The average abundance
   of meso litter and range of MPs was 11.08 +/- 16.65 items/m2 and 28.2
   +/- 5.9-60.8 +/- 23.3 particles/50 g respectively. Plastic (86\% in
   numbers and 71 \% in weight) was found to be the most common type of
   macro litter. The Clean Coast Index (CCI), Plastic Abundance Index
   (PAI), Microplastics Pollution Index (MPPI), Pollution Load Index (PLI),
   Polymer Hazard Index (PHI), and Coefficient of Microplastics Impact
   (CMPI) revealed that the beaches ranged from moderately clean to dirty,
   with moderate to high plastic abundance, corresponding to Hazard Level I
   and a high hazard score. The backshore area accumulated a majority of
   the macro litter than the intertidal region. Public and fishing
   activities could be the main sources of plastic litter. Given that the
   study area is a significant biosphere reserve and a popular pilgrimage
   site, plastic contamination can affect biodiversity and beach tourism
   drastically. The study recommends stringent enforcement of a total ban
   on single-use plastics in this area, systematic monitoring, and
   appropriate training for fishermen on the proper disposal of waste,
   especially fishing gear would be highly effective.},

Abstract = {In response to the growing environmental problems directly or indirectly
   caused by plastic bags, many national and local governments around the
   world have enacted legislation or ordinances to ban or tax plastic bags
   and associated products like paper bags. While the effectiveness of such
   policy interventions is highly dependent on consumer reaction and
   behavior change, there are limited empirical studies on how such
   legislation and ordinances have changed consumer behavior in terms of
   their plastic and paper bag use in the United States. This paper
   empirically assesses the impacts of the state-level legislation in
   Vermont that has banned single-use plastic bags and imposed a fee on
   paper bags. Findings from a statewide survey conducted in 2022 indicate
   that self-reported average weekly use of plastic bags dropped by 91.47\%
   and the average use of paper bags increased by 6.37\% after the
   legislation went into effect. Further, analysis results of the
   respondents divided into six typologies according to their use of paper
   bags before and after the legislation suggest that, while the tax effect
   of the paper bag fee was negative and significant and the substitution
   effect of the plastic bag ban on paper bag use was positive and
   significant, the positive substitution effect was likely stronger than
   the negative tax effect and therefore resulted in a positive but
   insignificant total effect on paper bag use. The empirical findings also
   suggest strong public support for the plastic bag ban, limited support
   for a potential paper bag ban, and a high level of public satisfaction
   with the legislation's implementation and enforcement.},

Title = {Preventing Microplastic Pollution in Surface Waters: Legal Frameworks
   and Strategic Actions},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {35},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Microplastic contamination of surface water is another looming
   environmental issue driven by fast industrialization, urbanization, and
   the rampant use of plastics. Microplastics are plastic particles smaller
   than 5 mm in size, and there are a variety of origins, including broken
   pieces of plastic waste, synthetic fibers, or industrial effluents. They
   are one of the pollutants that pose significant threats to aquatic
   ecosystems and human well-being because they carry toxic substances,
   disrupt aquatic food webs, and degrade water quality. This situation led
   India to formulate a series of regulatory frameworks for the reduction
   of plastic pollution. Other important policies are the 2016 Plastic
   Waste Management Rules, with a focus on recyclability and reduction of
   plastic waste at the source level, and the 2022 countrywide single-use
   plastic ban, which targets the spread of high-volume plastics that lead
   to microplastic pollution. India also works with international groups
   like the Global Partnership on Marine Litter and has integrated EPR into
   its plastic waste management to make it more long-lasting. In some
   states, incomplete or nonexistent waste management infrastructure and a
   lack of specific legislation on microplastics combine to raise concerns
   about enforcement. This review discusses the source and implications of
   microplastic contamination in the surface water, evaluates the
   effectiveness of the current legal regime, and highlights what could be
   done to strengthen the legislation and reduce microplastic
   contamination. Strengthened surveillance, state-of-the-art wastewater
   treatment technology, and awareness programs are essential before such
   elements can prevent the entry of microplastic contaminants and protect
   water bodies.},

Abstract = {This study investigates marine litter and its ecological impacts on the
   seafloor of the Thermaikos Gulf (NE Mediterranean Sea, Greece) for the
   first time, using data from 40 ROV dives (15-90 m depth) carried out
   between 2020 and 2024, and 11 scuba dives (0-5 m depth) conducted
   primarily at fishing ports during the same period. Plastics dominated
   the litter composition (80 \%), with fishing-related activities
   contributing to 65 \% of the litter at depths from 15 to 90 m, while
   single-use plastics comprised 46 \% of the litter at nearshore
   locations. ROV surveys revealed litter densities decreased with depth
   and were likely influenced by water circulation patterns and human
   activities, particularly fishing. Shallow waters exhibited 50 times
   higher densities, highlighting the severe accumulation of litter in
   nearshore areas, particularly in ports. Benthic animals observed in ROV
   footage were identified, and their abundance was recorded, providing
   insights into the ecosystem's exposure to litter. Moreover, documented
   faunal interactions, including ghost fishing, entanglement,
   colonization, and the use of litter for shelter, highlight the
   ecological threats posed by marine litter. These findings surpass
   established Mediterranean litter density thresholds for the seafloor,
   underscoring the urgent need for stricter waste management at ports and
   offshore, stronger enforcement of EU directives, and targeted
   educational campaigns. This research establishes benchmark levels for
   setting environmental objectives under the Marine Strategy Framework
   Directive and for conducting targeted research to address litter
   pollution in the Thermaikos Gulf and similar coastal regions.},

Title = {Evaluating public risk perception and governance options for
   microplastic contamination in the Yellow Sea},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {90},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Marine microplastics (MMP), are less than 5 mm in diameter, are a
   growing environmental pollutant of worldwide interest. They are
   hazardous to marine life and pose a potential risk to human health. The
   proper governance process requires public awareness and support,
   although there is limited information on how risk perception influences
   choices regarding management strategies. The objectives of this study
   were (1) to determine people's perceptions of the risks associated with
   MMP in Jiaozhou Bay, China, (2) to assess the governance choices, and
   (3) to investigate the impact of socio-demographic factors and perceived
   risks on willingness to pay (WTP) to mitigate them. A questionnaire
   survey was conducted among 442 Qingdao residents using a structured
   questionnaire. Respondents rated the perceived health and environmental
   risks of MMP and evaluated governance scenarios using the Choice
   Experiment Model (CEM). Latent class analysis and hybrid logistic
   regression were used to determine the determinants of preferences and
   heterogeneity in governance support. The majority of respondents (69.2
   \%) also identified MMP as a severe threat to human health, but few
   identified strong ecological risks. The policy variables that were most
   popular among the population included monitoring programs, average
   restrictions on single-use plastics, and ambivalent attitudes towards
   recycling systems. The younger and more educated respondents were more
   willing to pay, whereas the older respondents were less supportive of
   recycling actions. Latent class analysis identified two categories: one
   with a comprehensive management approach, which preferred all three
   strategies, and one with a preventive regulation approach, which
   preferred monitoring and plastic restrictions but weakly supported
   recycling. The results highlight the importance of aligning governance
   with social values. Enhancement of monitoring networks and open data
   sharing should be emphasized as a way of establishing confidence and
   awareness. Bans on plastic must be implemented gradually by investing in
   biodegradable substitutes and improving recycling systems, with
   community participation necessary to control MMP over the long term.
   Research highlights the importance of risk perception in determining the
   outcome of social support, providing evidence-based advice on the
   adaptive governance of new marine pollutants.},

Title = {Exploring cigarette butts pollution in Vung Tau beaches: A case study in
   Vietnam},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {212},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Cigarette butts (CBs), alongside other plastic items, are widely
   recognized as a significant source of marine litter in coastal areas
   worldwide. This research is the first to examine CB pollution, offering
   valuable insights into its impact across various beaches in Vung Tau,
   Vietnam. A total of 512 CBs were collected, with an average density of
   0.085 +/- 0.025 CBs m- 2. The cigarette butt pollution index (CBPI)
   values indicated two pollution levels: 8.3 \% classified as extremely
   low and 91.7\% as low. Cellulose acetate (CA) filters are considered a
   common hazardous item due to their widespread use, improper disposal,
   and associated risks. The hazardous items index (HII) ranged from 0.423
   to 1.350 items m- 2, with a mean of 1.041 items m- 2. Our investigation
   revealed that human activities drive coastal pollution, with the tourism
   industry contributing the highest abundance of littered CBs, largely due
   to common activities by the tourism industry and residents. The inputs
   from this investigation will help enrich the limited information on CB
   characteristics, sources, and pollution levels along the Vung Tau coast.
   It will also support efforts to address common single-use plastics
   (SUPs) and manage tourist activities on the country's beaches.
   Addressing these concerns requires policy frameworks, community
   engagement campaigns, and social participation. A practical and
   effective strategy to mitigate this pollution should be toward a
   circular economy approach, which focuses on reducing, reusing, and
   recycling CB plastic waste. Implementing powerful waste management
   practices and promoting environmentally sustainable products can
   mitigate CB contamination risks in essential marine areas and sensitive
   coastal ecosystems.},

Title = {Cured meat packaging: A whole system approach to the food product
   centric packaging solutions},
Journal = {FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {221},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Cured meat products are largely consumed as packaged food; however,
   their single-use packaging is made up of multilayer and multi-material
   fossil-based plastics to achieve the desired shelf life. While advanced
   recycling technologies are being developed, in the existing practices,
   these materials cannot be processed together, and their sorting and
   treatment are not only technically complicated or even impossible but
   also very expensive. Single-use plastic packaging and its waste are
   growing environmental, climate, and health concerns, but the packaging
   is only responsible for a portion of the entire waste and carbon
   footprint in food-packaging systems. Hence, the transformative
   sustainability change can only be achieved when the entire food and
   packaging supply chain can be fully addressed, food shelf life is not
   compromised by more sustainable packaging solutions and effective
   packaging waste management practices are implemented. Therefore,
   priority should be given to designing packaging with a product-centric
   approach and circular mindset for putting an end to wasteful packaging
   from the beginning, rather than handling waste at the end and investing
   more in emerging recycling technologies. When designing more sustainable
   concepts and materials (e.g. reusable, recycled, compostable packaging)
   food safety should be the first consideration that makes food packaging
   a unique challenge for several stakeholders. This review provides a
   comprehensive overview of current market packaging trends, and promising
   packaging solutions for cured meat, including a detailed elaboration on
   the status quo in processed meat packaging that can assist the industry
   and other key players in the direction of fewer resources and less
   waste.},

Title = {Impacts of Pandemic-Associated Plastic Waste on Microplastics in Ambient
   PM2.5},

Abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) are a rising environmental and health concern, and
   the COVID-19 pandemic has increased plastic waste, particularly
   single-use plastics. While the impacts of pandemic-associated plastic
   waste on multiple environmental matrices (e.g., water and soil) have
   been well documented, its effects on MPs in atmospheric fine particles
   (PM2.5) remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed the MPs in ambient
   PM2.5 collected from urban Xi'an before, during, and after the COVID-19
   pandemic in both summer and winter. Mean MP concentrations during and
   after the pandemic were three times higher than prepandemic levels,
   irrespective of the season. Transparent and white polypropylene and
   polyethylene terephthalate fibers dominated during and after the
   pandemic, while prepandemic MPs were more diverse in polymer types and
   colors. These results indicate a strong impact of pandemic-associated
   waste, especially discarded face masks, on the abundance and
   characteristics of MPs in ambient PM2.5. Additionally, a positive
   correlation was found between MPs and ambient ozone, suggesting the
   potential for ozone to degrade plastics and release MPs into the air.
   Multiple-path particle dosimetry calculations revealed that MPs
   primarily deposit in the extrathoracic region of people across all age
   groups. However, teenagers and younger individuals showed increased
   susceptibility to deposition in tracheobronchial and pulmonary regions.
   Based on the estimated daily dose, inhalation of MPs from ambient PM2.5
   is proposed to be a significant exposure pathway for humans. Overall,
   our study highlights the substantial impacts of pandemic-associated
   plastic waste on MPs in ambient PM2.5 and their potential implications
   for human exposure.},

Abstract = {The increasing reliance on single-use plastic packaging in the food
   industry has raised serious environmental and health concerns. This
   study explores the development of biodegradable packaging films loaded
   with green tea extract (GTE) as a sustainable alternative to
   conventional plastics. Biopolymeric films were fabricated from chitosan
   (CS) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrices using the solvent-casting
   method, and their mechanical, physicochemical, antioxidant, and
   antimicrobial properties were systematically evaluated. Incorporation of
   GTE enhanced the mechanical performance of the films compared with
   GTE-free controls, increasing tensile strength (TS) and elongation at
   break (E\%) by 12.5\% and 47\%, respectively. Thermal stability and
   water vapor permeability (WVP) improved by 8\%, while the oxygen
   transmission rate (OTR) decreased by 28.5\%. GTE-containing films also
   exhibited strong antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli
   andStaphylococcus aureus, where the addition of 0.2\% GTE resulted in
   357\% and 103\% increases in the OD\% parameter (percentage reduction in
   bacterial culture optical density indicating growth inhibition),
   respectively (p < 0.05). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis
   revealed only minor spectral changes, reflecting the low GTE content and
   limited interactions with the polymer matrix. Shelf-life tests on edible
   mushrooms demonstrated that GTE-based films effectively reduced weight
   loss and microbial growth during storage. Compared with the control
   (28.10 g), the N3 film significantly lowered mushroom weight loss to
   20.38 g (approximate to 27\% reduction), while N2 and N3 films markedly
   suppressed microbial activity and retained significantly greater
   firmness after seven days (p < 0.05). These findings highlight the
   potential of GTE-incorporated PVA/CS films as environmentally friendly
   and functional packaging materials capable of reducing plastic waste
   while maintaining food quality and safety.},

Title = {Potential for optimisation of fuel yield and hydrocarbon distribution
   from plastic waste pyrolysis using Nanopyroxene catalysts},
Journal = {RESULTS IN CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Plastic waste is a global concern, driven largely by the widespread use
   of single-use plastics. Despite advances in recycling technologies,
   scalable, and cost-effective plastic waste management solutions remain
   limited. Thermal pyrolysis offers a complementary pathway for plastic
   waste valorisation through energy recovery, but conventional processes
   are constrained by slow reaction rates, high energy demands, and low
   fuel yields. This study introduces, for the first time, nanopyroxene as
   a novel catalytic additive for plastic waste pyrolysis in a locally
   fabricated batch reactor, aiming to improve fuel yield and hydrocarbon
   distribution. A mixture of Low-density polyethylene (LDPE), High-density
   polyethylene (HDPE), and polypropylene (PP) (2:1:2 ratio) was thermally
   decomposed under catalysed and non-catalysed conditions. The
   physico-chemical properties of the resulting plastic-derived fuel oils
   (PDFOs) were benchmarked against commercial diesel. Catalytic pyrolysis
   significantly increased the fuel oil yield to 77 \%, compared to 56 \%
   from non-catalytic pyrolysis (p < 0.05). The catalyst promoted the
   formation of light hydrocarbons (C-1-C-9) and reduced intermediate
   fractions but increased ultra-heavy hydrocarbons (C-25-C-56), which
   potentially affects combustion efficiency. Physical characterisation
   revealed no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) between
   PDFOs and commercial diesel in key fuel properties, all of which fell
   within recommended standards. However, PDFOs exhibited higher
   volatility, density, and flammability, with lower flash and fire points
   (39 degrees C, 48 degrees C), suggesting suitability for high-energy
   combustion applications. These findings demonstrate the potential of
   nanopyroxene to enhance fuel yield and quality from plastic pyrolysis,
   though further optimisation, detailed catalytic mechanisms, and
   comprehensive environmental impact assessments are necessary for
   large-scale adoption.},

Abstract = {Edible cutlery (cups, bowls, and spoons) are emerging as sustainable
   alternatives to single-use plastics and laminated paper containers,
   offering both environmental benefits and functional versatility. These
   products are primarily fabricated from bio-based polymers, including
   starches, millet flours, plant fibers, and proteins such as soy, casein,
   and gelatin. Despite their promise, large-scale adoption is limited by
   low mechanical strength, moisture sensitivity, thermal instability, and
   short shelf life. This comprehensive review highlights recent
   advancements in the design, fabrication, and functional enhancement of
   biodegradable edible cutlery. It covers raw materials, processing
   techniques including molding, baking, thermal pressing, and extrusion
   and key strategies for improving performance, such as
   protein-polysaccharide composites, food-grade crosslinking, bioactive
   incorporation, and multilayer hydrophobic coatings. The manuscript also
   addresses critical practical aspects, including shelf stability,
   scalability, consumer sensory acceptance, economic feasibility, safety,
   and regulatory compliance, with references to international standards
   and food-safety laws. Real-time applications in caf \& eacute;s,
   restaurants, and consumer settings are discussed, along with
   sustainability considerations and life cycle assessment (LCA) to
   evaluate environmental impact. Finally, the review identifies knowledge
   gaps, particularly the need for standardized methods to assess
   durability, moisture resistance, and sensory performance. Compared to
   previous reviews on plant flour-based edible tableware, this work
   provides a broader perspective encompassing composite systems, advanced
   functionalization strategies, and integration of sustainability and
   commercial applicability. By combining material science insights,
   practical considerations, and environmental evaluation, this review
   underscores the transformative potential of edible cutlery in
   sustainable packaging and foodservice systems.},

Abstract = {Packaging reduction, particularly in terms of single-use plastic (SUP)
   packaging waste, as well as restrictions on specific packaging formats
   and regulatory requirements, are driving the demand for sustainable
   packaging solutions. Notably, within the category of SUP products,
   packaging accounts for the highest share at 40\%. Therefore, advanced
   bio-based food packaging technologies are essential for extending the
   lifespan of perishable food products, while maintaining their
   nutritional value and ensuring food safety and security. This review
   provides a comprehensive overview of published articles, highlighting
   the innovations in edible packaging films, coatings, and antimicrobial
   agents for applications in the food industry, intending to help
   scientists, companies, and consumers make informed decisions. The
   advantages and challenges with polysaccharide, protein, and lipid-based
   edible packaging materials are discussed. A detailed description of
   various food-safe antimicrobial agents, along with their antimicrobial
   mechanisms, incorporation techniques, and regulations, is provided. By
   leveraging natural bioactive compounds, antimicrobial edible packaging
   provides significant advantages over chemical-based antimicrobial
   agents. Additionally, encapsulation techniques help control release and
   enhance the stability and effectiveness of antimicrobial agents, thereby
   prolonging the shelf life of perishable food products. On the basis of
   recent advancements, rapid growth in antimicrobial edible food packaging
   can be anticipated. Further, the review focuses on the importance of
   safety and regulatory aspects related to nanoparticle (NP) migration and
   appropriate labeling on antimicrobial edible packaging along with key
   challenges highlighting cost, consumer acceptance, and large-scale
   production. Finally, it highlights the potential of utilizing food-grade
   antimicrobial agents with edible polymers for the sustainable
   preservation of perishable food products.},

Title = {Tradescantia pallida extract incorporated chitosan/pullulan
   intelligent biodegradable films: an eco-friendly packaging to preserve
   the freshness of chicken},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE FOOD TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 NOV 10},
Abstract = {Herein, biodegradable active films were developed using a polysaccharide
   based blend of chitosan (CS) and pullulan (PU), incorporated with the
   ethanolic extract of Tradescantia pallida (TP), to function as
   intelligent food packaging materials. FTIR confirmed intermolecular
   hydrogen bonding between the polyphenolic constituents of TP extract and
   the CS/PU matrix. The resulting CPT intelligent biodegradable films
   exhibited an impressive tensile strength of 45.84 MPa, surpassing that
   of conventional plastic films. SEM micrographs revealed a uniform and
   compact surface morphology, demonstrating successful blending and
   structural integrity. The incorporation of polyphenolic compounds not
   only enhanced the antimicrobial efficacy of the films against foodborne
   pathogens but also imparted remarkable antioxidant potential, as
   evidenced by DPPH (89.81\%) and ABTS (85.14\%) radical scavenging
   activities. A distinct color shift from purple to yellow upon spoilage
   enabled real-time monitoring of freshness. Chicken samples packaged in
   polyethylene (PE) and CPT-2 intelligent biodegradable films were stored
   under ambient conditions. Analyses of microbial growth, ammonia release,
   free fatty acid degradation, and the effects of UV exposure revealed
   that CPT-2 intelligent biodegradable films offered superior protection
   against microbial contamination and oxidative deterioration, thereby
   extending the chicken's shelf life compared to PE packaging. The CPT
   intelligent biodegradable films also showed biodegradation potential,
   addressing the persistence, landfill accumulation, and greenhouse gas
   emissions associated with single-use plastics. Thereby mitigating the
   adverse impacts of SUPs on human health and the ecosystem. Overall, the
   physicochemically enhanced intelligent films offer a sustainable and
   effective alternative to plastic packaging, improving food safety and
   environmental health.},

Title = {The Evaluation of Corporate Sustainability Strategies in Italy:
   Challenges and Opportunity of Recycled Packaging},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {The scientific literature and practice have demonstrated that the old
   linear economic model ``extract-produce-use and throw away{''} is no
   longer sustainable due to the enormous accumulation of waste and the
   related production of CO2. Consequently, there is a need to adopt more
   sustainable development systems that include recycling resources and
   producing goods derived from recycled material. The examined literature
   highlights that SMEs are the least likely to make technological or
   paradigm changes in favor of sustainable choices due to a lack of
   resources and managerial competencies. This study presents a
   mixed-method approach based on qualitative and quantitative analyses.
   The qualitative analysis aims to identify, in the Italian context,
   measures that encourage companies to reduce the use of plastics in favor
   of sustainable alternatives. The quantitative analysis, based on
   secondary data, aims to identify the characteristics of the firms that
   benefited from the aid identified in the previous analysis. Thus, this
   study may support corporate environmental sustainability strategies in
   Italy by identifying specific characteristics and profiles of those
   companies willing to obtain public incentives for the use of recycled
   materials in their business and production processes. The results show
   that small and micro-sized companies obtained most of the analyzed
   incentives (almost 76\% in terms of number of applications), and the
   most affected areas by these measures are the agriculture and food
   industries. Therefore, economic incentives can improve sustainable
   performance for small and micro-sized enterprises in the wide agri-food
   sector, while the legislator must adopt different tools, such as bans,
   Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), and sustainability reports for
   medium-large sized companies of other crucial industrial sectors such as
   construction and automotives.},

Title = {The dawn of a new air pollutant: inhalable microplastics as emerging
   vectors of hazardous contaminants and their implications for human
   health},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {205},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This study presents the first comprehensive research on inhalable
   microplastics (iMPs, <10 mu m), a notorious subset of airborne
   microplastics (AMPs). To identify human health risk, ambient iMPs
   concentrations were assessed at human breathing height across the
   markets of four major Indian cities. With winter evening being the
   highest iMPs concentration, in Kolkata (14.23 <mu>g/m(3)), followed by
   Delhi (14.18 mu g/m(3)), linked to the highest footfalls, use of
   synthetic clothing, and poor waste management. Coastal cities (Chennai:
   4 mu g/m(3), and Mumbai: 2.65 mu g/m(3)) showed lower levels, likely due
   to improved air circulation, less winter, and reduced apparel, confirmed
   by Principal Component Analysis. Py-GC-MS quantified 11 polymers, with
   PET (Polyester) from textiles as the most abundant, followed by PE and
   SBR from single-use plastics, packaging, vehicles, and footwear. Urban
   areas in India show an average iMPs concentration of 8.8 mu g/m(3),
   translating to a lifetime lung load of similar to 2.9 g/person.
   Furthermore, this investigation highlights the risks of iMPs-associated
   tracers such as diethyl phthalates and lead. This pioneering research is
   the first-ever study to explore AMPs carrier capabilities for ultrafine
   particulate matter, PTEs, POPs, PPCPs, and microbes. During peak
   exposure periods like autumn festivals, AMPs harbored diverse microbial
   communities, including pathogenic (Aspergillus fumigatus) and new
   strains of bacteria/fungi with antibiotic resistance and virulence
   factor genes. This suggests that microbes carried by iMPs possess
   enhanced pathogenicity and resistance against broad-spectrum drugs like
   tetracycline and are more likely to be multidrug-resistant.
   Cross-referencing toxicological databases revealed that exposure to
   AMPs-linked modern-day contaminants elevates the risk of cancer,
   gastrointestinal, endocrine, breast, and respiratory diseases.},

Abstract = {The study investigated the potential of tapioca starch (Manihot
   esculenta) as a raw material for food packaging enhanced with basil leaf
   oil, citric acid, and carboxymethyl cellulose. The objective of this
   study was to standardize active edible tapioca films and evaluate their
   physicochemical, textural, and barrier properties (oxygen and water
   vapor transmission rates), microbial load, brine shrimp lethality assay
   (BSLA), and biodegradability. Films were produced using a casting
   technique with tapioca starch (10 g), dried using a film-making machine,
   and enhanced with 0.1 g citric acid as a crosslinker, 0.5 g
   carboxymethyl cellulose as a filler, and 1 ml basil leaf oil as an
   additive. Tapioca film (30 x 21 cm, 0.25 mm thickness) exhibited 3\%-5\%
   moisture, 1\%-2\% ash, and a pH of 5-6, with tensile strengths ranging
   from 2.48 to 6.28 MPa and elongation at break between 10.36\% and
   16.75\% oxygen transmission rate was 690.05 to 811.14 cc/m2/day, and
   water vapor transmission rate was 0.73 to 1.21 cm3/m2/24h/0.1 MPa. The
   inclusion of citric acid, carboxymethyl cellulose, and basil leaf oil
   improved the tensile strength and barrier properties, making the films
   suitable for packaging a variety of food products (cereals, legumes,
   spices, condiments, extruded products, and sugar candies) for up to 120
   days. The microbial load remained below 5.7 x 101 CFU/g, with low
   toxicity (7\% in BSLA), and the films degraded completely in moist
   topsoil within 24 days. This study highlights the tapioca starch films
   enhanced with carboxymethyl cellulose, citric acid and basil oilas a
   sustainable alternative to single-use plastics. It provides an effective
   packaging solution for non-perishable commodities and sugar candies with
   improved functional properties and environment sustainability.},

Abstract = {Smart packaging is revolutionizing the food industry by extending shelf
   life and enhancing quality, thus ensuring food safety and
   sustainability. This study presents innovative multilayer flexible
   packaging films to tackle the environmental challenges of single-use
   plastics and nonrecyclable metalized multilayer films. The fabricated
   films comprise three layers made up of poly(lactic acid) (PLA),
   poly(vinyl alcohol)/natural rubber latex, and PLA/Sepiolite clay from
   inner to outer, respectively, where the active middle layer provides
   oxygen-scavenging activity. The findings indicate that developed films
   can effectively increase the shelf life of foods, such as Palm oil,
   showing no visible color change and significant improvement in peroxide
   value (PV) and p-anisidine values (p-AV) after 30 days of storage study.
   As per the Shaal oven test, it extends Palm oil's shelf life to more
   than 3 years. Furthermore, the multilayer structure enhances mechanical
   and barrier properties and reduces oxygen transfer by 99\% and water
   vapor permeability by over 50-fold compared to neat PLA while promoting
   degradability. With lower environmental impacts, these films can be
   composted or degraded naturally. This green and biodegradable packaging
   strategy offers a promising solution to reduce food waste, contributing
   to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and fostering a
   circular economy.},

Abstract = {This study explores the role of thermoplastic starch (TPS) in
   accelerating the degradation of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a
   widely used single-use plastic that contributes significantly to
   environmental pollution. By blending TPS with LDPE, the research focuses
   on the abiotic degradation of these plastic films under simulated
   environmental conditions through photo-oxidation via accelerated
   weathering tests. Over a 10-week period-representing approximately nine
   months of natural exposure-the films were exposed to light, air,
   moisture, and heat. The degradation mechanisms were analyzed using
   Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Differential Scanning
   Calorimetry (DSC), while film disintegration was closely monitored. An
   additional 8-week seedling experiment assessed the impact of the
   degraded films on plant growth. Results indicated that LDPE/TPS blends
   began disintegrating after 6 weeks (approximately 5.4 months), achieving
   a 36 \% degradation rate and reaching complete disintegration at 10
   weeks. This surpassed the degradation performance of both standard
   biodegradable plastics and Oxo-PE. The primary degradation driver was
   water infiltration, which induced film swelling and contraction, leading
   to LDPE molecular chain breakdown. These findings provide critical
   insights into the disintegration mechanisms of LDPE/TPS blends and
   present a promising approach to accelerating plastic degradation,
   potentially reducing environmental plastic waste.},

Title = {Distribution of microplastics in the soils of a petrochemical industrial

Abstract = {Although microplastic pollution is a global concern, information on the
   distribution of microplastics in petroleum and petrochemical urban soils
   is limited. In this study, we investigated the occurrence, ecological
   risk, and human exposure risk of microplastics in different land-use
   types of soil in Daqing Administrative region, a prominent petroleum and
   petrochemical industrial base in China. Stereoscopic microscopy and
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (mu-FTIR) were used to study the
   chemical composition and distribution characteristics of microplastics.
   We found that the abundance of microplastics in Daqing soil ranged from
   714 to 11,122 items/kg, with the highest value in educational land and
   the lowest in parks and green land. The dominant particle size of
   microplastics was < 1 mm (65.7\%), and the shape was mainly fiber
   (55.1\%), with white (28.9\%) and black (25.6\%) as the predominant
   colors. The most common polymer types were rayon, polypropylene, and
   polyethylene. Using the potential ecological risk index (RI) and
   polymeric risk index (H), we found that all land-use types, except
   woodland (Level I), were classified into Level V of ecological risk,
   with the highest risk in industrial land (RI = 14,959.85, H = 588.31).
   The daily exposure of infants to microplastics was much higher than that
   of adults. These findings provide valuable data for the pollution and
   potential risk assessment of microplastics in urban and rural
   environments, suggesting the importance of taking action to minimize its
   harmful effects on ecological and human health. In order to control the
   pollution caused by microplastics, we suggest that people should reduce
   the unnecessary use of single-use plastic items, such as water bottles,
   plastic shopping bags, straws, etc. In addition, the government needs to
   strengthen rubbish collection to prevent plastic waste from leaking into
   the environment during the period from the rubbish bins to the
   landfills, and to build recycling systems to increase the recycling
   rate.},

Title = {Occurrence of Microplastics in Inland and Island Wastewater Treatment

Abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) are increasingly recognized as emerging contaminants
   in aquatic environments; however, their occurrence and fate in tropical
   wastewater treatment systems remain poorly understood. This study
   provides the first inland-island comparison of MP removal in wastewater
   treatment plants (WWTPs) across Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor.
   Influent and effluent samples were collected from six WWTPs,
   encompassing five treatment types: oxidation ditch, aerated lagoon,
   stabilization pond, aerated tank, and sand filtration combined with
   reverse osmosis. Polymeric composition and size distribution were
   examined in parallel with conventional water quality indicators. Across
   all sites, polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene dominated influent MPs,
   together accounting for 57-92\% of total abundance. Inland plants
   received heterogeneous municipal wastewater, including domestic inputs
   and agricultural runoff. In contrast, island facilities consistently
   showed PE-enriched influents (45-60\%) in site F, reflecting
   tourism-driven reliance on single-use plastics and personal care
   products. In addition, several minor polymers were identified, including
   poly (vinyl stearate) (up to 26\%), polyamide, polytetrafluoroethylene
   and ethylene-butyl acrylate, highlighting overlooked pathways of MP
   entry into WWTPs. Fine MPs (100-300 mu m) comprised over two-thirds of
   influent particles, with stabilization ponds reaching 16,000 MP m-3.
   Removal efficiency ranged from 86.0\% to 98.5\%. Spearman's correlation
   and multiple linear regression analyses revealed strong positive
   relationships between MPs and both total suspended solids (TSS) and
   turbidity. Suspended solids parameters emerged as the most reliable
   predictor of MP abundance (adjusted R2 = 0.91, p = 0.001). This finding
   highlights TSS coupled with turbidity as a practical, cost-effective
   indicator for monitoring MPs in tropical WWTPs. To achieve greater
   accuracy, a larger dataset should be built and further analyzed.},

Title = {Is Sustainability Part of the Drill? Examining Knowledge and Awareness
   Among Dental Students in Bucharest, Romania},

Abstract = {Background. Despite dentistry's alarmingly high energy use, plastic
   waste, and travel emissions, research on Romanian dental students'
   sustainability awareness is absent. This study aimed to assess their
   knowledge of the environmental impact of dental materials and practices,
   hypothesizing that early exposure to sustainability education would
   benefit preclinical students most. Materials and Methods. A
   cross-sectional survey using a form questionnaire with 15 items was
   conducted on 1800 dental students at Carol Davila University of Medicine
   and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania, for one week in March 2022. The
   questionnaire, consisting of socio-demographics, students' perspectives
   on sustainability in dentistry, and personal sustainability, was
   analyzed using SPSS 26. Data analysis included the Shapiro-Wilk test for
   normality, Fisher's exact test for categorical variables, the
   Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric quantitative comparisons, and
   Z-tests with Bonferroni correction for contingency tables. Results. A
   response rate of 26.06\% was achieved, with 469 participants. The
   majority (51.1\%), particularly males (66.1\%), perceived sustainability
   as promoting durability. The most common definition of sustainability
   (33.8\%) was related to environmental protection, with significantly
   higher agreement among female students (39.4\%) (p = 0.001). While
   49.3\% of participants identified single-use plastics in patient care as
   having the greatest environmental impact in dental practices, 39.2\% of
   female students, primarily from clinical study years (50\%), ranked
   patient paperwork and records as the most significant factor (p =
   0.031). The highest-carbon-footprint dental procedures were considered
   to be amalgam and composite fillings (50.7\%), with clinical year
   students indicating this as the most relevant issue (62.8\% vs. 47.7\%)
   (p = 0.011). Students aged 25-30 were more actively engaged in
   sustainability initiatives compared to the younger group (p = 0.005),
   while all students over 30 identified scaling and polishing as the most
   impactful procedure (p < 0.001). A majority of students supported future
   university sustainability initiatives (62.7\%) and an elective course on
   sustainability in dentistry (65\%). Female students showed significantly
   greater interest than male students in both initiatives (66.3\% vs.
   52.7\%, p = 0.003 and 70.8\% vs. 49.6\%, p < 0.001, respectively).
   Conclusions. Greater awareness of sustainability was found in
   preclinical-year dental students and among female students, with
   knowledge gaps in clinical-year students, particularly regarding the
   environmental impact of dental practices and materials. Introducing
   sustainability courses could better prepare future dentists for
   sustainable practices in dentistry. Research collaborations and
   curriculum reforms to further promote sustainability would also be
   beneficial.},

Title = {Optimizing Edible Sorghum Bowls: Effects of Roasting and Edible Flower
   Powder Enhancement on Technological, Nutritional, Antioxidant, and
   Functional Properties},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {2025},

Abstract = {The widespread reliance on single-use plastics (SUPs) has fostered a
   global throwaway culture, especially in the food packaging industry,
   where convenience and low cost have driven their adoption, posing
   serious environmental threats, particularly to marine ecosystems and
   biodiversity. Edible and ecofriendly packaging made from millet,
   specifically sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), is a promising
   solution to mitigate SUP consumption and promote sustainability. This
   study explores the development of edible sorghum bowls, enhanced through
   roasting and incorporating 3 g of hibiscus and rose flower powders. The
   standardized sorghum bowl was analyzed for nutritional value; optical,
   technological, functional, and mechanical properties; and shelf life,
   and the results were discussed. The bowls, 18.5 g of average weight,
   dimensions of 10.2 cm, and a thickness of 3 mm, were baked in a unique
   bowl-shaped mold at 80 degrees C for 7 min. Enhancing the bowls with
   flower powder improved their optical properties and nutrient content.
   The addition of flower powder also increased phytochemical levels,
   according to qualitative analysis, while roasting sorghum reduced tannin
   and phytic acid content. The IC50 values revealed that hibiscus (47.74
   mg/mL) and rose (39.87 mg/mL) enrichment boosted antioxidant activity.
   Sensory evaluations favored roasted bowls across all attributes, while
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermogravimetric
   analyzer (TGA) analyses confirmed significant structural changes. The
   enhanced bowls exhibited greater hardness and hold hot or cold snacks
   for 90 min without compromising structural integrity. Additionally,
   these bowls demonstrated an extended shelf life, low microbial count (1
   x 101CFU/g), reduced toxicity (3\%-10\% mortality in brine shrimp
   assays), and complete biodegradation within 15 days in wet soil. These
   findings indicate that sorghum-based edible bowls present a nutritious,
   viable, less toxic alternative to SUPs, appealing to a broad
   demographic, especially in the food and tourism sector, and contributing
   to environmental conservation by reducing plastic waste and suitable for
   wide consumption.},

   plastic waste: Challenges, mitigation measures, and policy interventions},

Abstract = {The rapid accumulation of plastic waste in the environment poses a
   significant global challenge, exacerbating ecosystem pollution and
   public health risks. Annually, approximately 8 million tons of plastic
   waste enter the oceans, contributing to ecosystem degradation and human
   exposure to toxic substances. Toxins such as phthalates, bisphenol A
   (BPA), dioxins, furans, and heavy metal residues released from plastic
   degradation cause severe health risks, including endocrine disruption,
   carcinogenesis, and respiratory diseases. This study reviews exposure
   pathways and bioaccumulation mechanisms of plastic-derived toxins, their
   health risks, mitigation strategies, and policy interventions. The
   findings reveal that BPA concentrations in rivers can exceed 12 mu g/L,
   and dioxins in soil surpass 1000 ng Toxic Equivalency Quotient (TEQ)/kg
   in areas with open burning, exceeding WHO thresholds. In Poland,
   landfill leachate shows phthalate levels over 303 mu g/L, while heavy
   metals in fish tissue reached over 2.26 ng/g wet weight in Sweden.
   Vulnerable populations in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs),
   particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, face heightened risk exposure, with
   39-45 \% of urban waste being formally managed. Despite recycling
   efforts, only 9 \% of plastic waste is recycled globally, while open
   burning and inadequate incineration release hazardous pollutants like
   dioxins and furans. Advanced solutions, such as chemical recycling, with
   recovery rates up to 97 \% for polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and
   enzymatic degradation, achieving 90 \% plastic breakdown in 10 h, show
   promise but face scalability challenges. Case studies from Germany,
   Japan, and Rwanda demonstrate effective strategies, including extended
   producer responsibility schemes and bans on single-use plastics,
   achieving recycling rates exceeding 41 \% and reducing waste by 90 \%.
   However, challenges persist, particularly in low-and middle-income
   countries with inadequate waste management infrastructure. This study
   concludes by recommending stricter regulations, investment in advanced
   recycling technologies, development of bioplastics, and international
   collaborations to mitigate health risks and environmental contamination
   from plastic waste.},

   Engineering Design Approach Yields a Novel Concept for Circularity and
   Sustainability},

Abstract = {Durable plastics are a sustainability challenge for healthcare products.
   Orthopedic products are regulated with strict specifications for human
   tissue interactions. Healthcare engineers and managers select plastic to
   meet the full range of material properties. Plastic is plentiful, low
   cost, and reliable, with established supply chains. Used plastic
   products can be discarded using existing waste management systems with
   low externality costs for orthopedic businesses. However, plastic is
   produced from fossil petroleum, raising issues for sustainability
   commitments of healthcare product companies. Barriers to the transition
   away from single-use plastic toward circular systems and bio-based
   healthcare products have been studied, but the transition is a goal that
   has yet to be realized. This research article reports on a transition
   engineering design sprint with a medium-sized orthopedic company
   specializing in orthoses for children and teenagers. The design sprint
   process engages company experts with systems perspectives on the role of
   unsustainable plastic in orthopedic healthcare and illuminates
   opportunities for capturing value in business transition. Two system
   transition project concepts were co-developed. The first concept is a
   plastics value map that aims to converge the satisfaction of essential
   needs with the usefulness of plastics under the limitations of a
   biophysically constrained future economy. The second concept is an
   orthopedics library data system concept that would allow reusing of
   fit-for-purpose used products and to inform the refurbishment of used
   products. In addition to an explanation of the design of the two
   concepts, the article presents reflections of co-design stakeholders on
   the usefulness and usability of the concepts. The article provides a
   real-world application of the co-design processes in transition
   engineering and the reflection by the company on the value of the
   results. The results indicate that the co-designed concepts could enable
   the company to address its sustainability aspirations and potentially
   resolve the dissonance of sustainability and business viability.},

   assessments. Our study identified key litter items and assessed
   pollution sources on urban, semi-urban, tourist, and semi-rural beaches.
   Macro-litter concentration averaged 5032 +/- 4919 pieces per 100 m or
   1.71 +/- 2.28 pieces/m(2), with higher values observed on urban (mean
   2.63 pieces/m(2) +/- 3.03) and tourist (mean 1.23 pieces/m(2)+/- 0.91)
   beaches. Similarly, urban (mean 9.91 pieces/m(2)+/- 12.70) and tourist
   beaches (mean 5.32 pieces/m(2)+/- 4.48) revealed elevated levels of
   meso-litter contamination, particularly in the upper third of the beach,
   which contained the highest quantities both in terms of number (51\%)
   and weight (50\%). 55\% of the macro-litter and 35\% of the meso-litter
   originated from human shoreline activities and poor waste management.
   Given the width of some beaches and their high levels of pollution, the
   standard 100 m macro-litter approach was impractical. To enable
   cost-effective, long-term monitoring, we adapted it to a faster 10 m
   transect approach, which provided reliable data on the top 25 litter
   items, accounting for 82\% of beach pollution. Our Sand Rake method
   effectively quantified pollution on both cleaned and uncleaned beaches,
   addressing the often neglected meso-litter size fraction. The high
   pollution levels, top litter items, and identified sources indicate that
   beach cleaning alone will not solve the pollution problem. Efforts to
   raise environmental awareness, enhanced waste management, and law
   enforcement are needed to improve the situation in a sustainable way.},

Abstract = {In recent years, environmental pollution and plastic waste have become a
   significant problem worldwide. The long-term retention of single-use
   plastic waste in nature harms ecosystems and threatens biodiversity.
   Sustainable solutions such as increasing recycling processes and using
   biodegradable and environmentally friendly materials are gaining
   importance to prevent environmental pollution. Thermoplastic
   polyurethane (TPU) is widely used in wound dressing studies, but its
   petroleum-derived nature prevents recycling. When TPU is used by mixing
   it with a biodegradable polymer such as polybutylene succinate,
   polylactic acid (PLA), and polycaprolactone (PCL) a partially
   biodegradable and environmentally friendly structure is obtained.
   Moreover, the biological advantages of TPU continue to be utilized. In
   this study, eco-friendly hollow electrospun mats were produced from
   biocompatible biobased polybutylene succinate (BioPBS) and thermoplastic
   polyurethane (TPU) mixtures in different ratios (80:20, 60:40, 50:50,
   40:60, and 20:80, w:w) by coaxial electrospinning. It was planned to
   produce biomedical materials that exhibit liquid absorption behavior by
   emptying the core of hydrophobic BioPBS/TPU mixture nanofibers. Hollow
   BioPBS/TPU nanofibers were designed to be used as skin wound dressings
   in exuding wounds. Hollow electrospun mats, which absorb water to their
   full capacity, dried within 2 and 3 min. Ethanol used to remove the core
   of the fiber was reported to improve the fiber properties relative to
   the use of distilled water. PBS/TPU (60/40, w/w) electrospun mat was
   reported to have the densest fibrous structure, smoothest fibers, and
   least sticky fibers. FTIR spectra showed that PBS and TPU interacted
   physically. The mechanical properties of nanofibers were improved owing
   to the high surface/volume ratio, which increased with the PBS/TPU
   mixture and hollow structure. It was stated that hollow nanofibers met
   the tensile stress (1-20 MPa) value that could be used as a skin tissue
   wound dressing. PBS/TPU (60/40, w/w) and PBS/TPU (50/50, w/w)
   electrospun mats had the highest fibroblast cell (L929) viability with
   values of 80.64\% and 71.44\%, respectively. It was suggested that these
   nanofibers could be used as a dermal wound dressing for 24 h.},

Abstract = {The plastic waste produced from plastic consumption is largely
   non-biodegradable, and incineration technology is usually used for its
   proper disposal, which leads to air pollution. This air pollution is
   responsible for increasing respiratory disorders; globally, about 7
   million individuals die from air pollution-related diseases (APDs).
   Sustainable management of plastic waste is necessary to reduce air
   pollution and integrated the use of green nanotechnologies, natural
   resources management, economic complexities, and effective use of
   renewable energy are major factors. The present work utilizes the
   Fourier augmented autoregressive distributed lag approach to evaluate
   how all these ameliorative measures can be effective in managing plastic
   pollution and linked to associated deaths in China from 2000 to 2022.
   Results indicate that the use of plastic, green nanotechnologies (GN),
   natural resources, and economic complexity contributes to an increase in
   mortality caused by air pollution, but the use of renewable energy has a
   mitigating effect on air pollution-related deaths. The results depict
   that plastic waste incineration-driven air pollution is responsible for
   many of these deaths, and it also suggests that higher GN spending is
   directly correlated with higher APD, which is predominantly associated
   with single-use plastic in the GN sector. Doubling plastic use resulted
   in a 0.75\% increase in related deaths, while the adoption of green
   energy reduced these fatalities by 0.085\% annually. The findings prove
   that enhanced dependence on renewable energy technologies can help in
   the potential reduction of air pollution-related deaths, which is also
   in line with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
   i.e., SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and SDG 12 (Responsible
   Consumption and Production). Investigation paves the way for
   understanding how the potential relationship between environmental
   factors and health outcomes can be positively modulated in China.},

Title = {Sustainable export packaging for black pepper: paper-based solutions for
   a greener future},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-MYSORE},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 NOV 10},
Abstract = {The packaging industry predominantly relies on plastic due to its
   accessibility. However, single-use plastics (SUPs) constitute a
   significant portion of food packaging and typically end up in landfills
   after use, leading to detrimental environmental effects. To address the
   issues associated with SUPs, the present study evaluated bulk packaging
   for black pepper, considering multiwall sustainable paper packaging
   without wax coating (M1), with wax coating (M2), MET PET lamination
   (M3), and aluminum foil lamination (M4). Among them, MET PET (3.48
   g/m2<middle dot>day) and aluminum foil (0.908 g/m2<middle dot>day)
   exhibited superior moisture barrier properties compared to the control
   package M1 (10.5 g/m2<middle dot>day). Due to inadequate moisture
   barrier performance, the black pepper packed in M1 reached the critical
   moisture content (CMC) within 81 days, which led to the formation of
   small lumps and caking in the packed black pepper, resulting in product
   deterioration and a reduced aroma. In contrast, the black pepper packed
   in the M4 package extended the shelf life to 300 days. Transport
   worthiness tests confirmed that all packaging variants used in the study
   were suitable for export. However, the M4 multilayered packaging
   demonstrated the most extended shelf life of 300 days under ambient
   conditions (27 +/- 2 degrees C and 65 +/- 2\% RH), outperforming the
   others. These findings suggest that M4 multilayered packaging can be an
   effective alternative to SUPs, supporting producers in advancing
   sustainability and contributing to a circular economy.},

Title = {Take-out containers as nano- and microplastics reservoirs: Diet-driven
   gut dysbiosis in university students},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {384},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Microplastics and nanoplastics (MNPs) are presenting a significant
   challenge to global ecosystems and human health, however, human evidence
   on NPs-specific effects and their impacts on gut microbiota remains
   absent. This study investigated the exposure characteristics of MPs/NPs
   and their associations with gut microbiota dysbiosis in a high-risk
   population-university students. Fecal samples from 24 university
   students were analyzed via Raman spectroscopy and micro-FTIR for
   comprehensive MPs/NPs characterization. 16S rRNA gene sequencing
   revealed taxonomic shifts linked to MPs/NPs exposure. Questionnaires
   were used to assess potential exposure pathways to MPs in humans.
   Through integrated Raman spectroscopy, micro-FTIR, and 16S rRNA gene
   sequencing, we characterized MPs/ NPs in fecal samples (n = 24) while
   correlating exposure levels with microbial shifts. Microplastics were
   universally detected in fecal samples across all study participants,
   with concentrations ranging from 170.86 to 269.33 particles/100g,
   predominantly polyethylene terephthalate (PET, 83.42 \%) and fibers
   (85.95 \%). NPs (< 0.1 <mu>m) constituted only 0.14 \%. Frequent
   consumers of plastic-packaged foods (>= 3/day) exhibited significantly
   higher total MPs, PET, polyethylene (PE), and fibers versus infrequent
   users. The analysis found a moderate correlation between participants'
   drinking water intake and fecal Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) concentrations
   (r = 0.434, P = 0.034). Gut microbiota analysis revealed that despite no
   significant n-diversity shifts, the exposurestratified analysis
   uncovered critical taxonomic alterations with potential metabolic
   implications. The highconcentration group enriched Megasphaera and
   Shewanella while depleting Romboutsia at the genus level (P < 0.05).
   Similarly, NP-negative group individuals exhibited higher Proteobacteria
   and Desulfobacterota (P < 0.05), higher Desulfovibrio,
   {[}Eubacterium]\_eligens\_group, and Negativibacillus, yet lower
   butyrate-producing Butyricicoccus compared to NP-positive group (P <
   0.05). This study provides the first human evidence of NPs-associated
   gut dysbiosis, linking varying MP concentrations and sizes to gut
   microbiota alterations; it highlights dietary plastic packaging as a key
   exposure source. This work bridges critical gaps between in vitro NPs
   toxicity and real-world human health impacts, advocating for stricter
   regulations on single-use plastic packaging in food delivery systems
   targeting youth populations.},

Abstract = {Most of the literature on microplastics (MPs) focuses on freshwater or
   terrestrial ecosystems, frequently overlooking their interconnections
   with the marine environments. This oversight is worrying given that both
   ecosystems serve as primary pathways for the introduction of MPs into
   marine environments. This review synthesizes existing literature on MPs
   in both freshwater and marine ecosystems across all six continents. The
   most commonly produced plastic polymers in industry are polyethylene (36
   \%) and polypropylene (21 \%), and studies revealed that these two
   materials are the most abundant in aquatic ecosystems. Primary and
   secondary MPs originate from a range of sources including land-based
   disposal, the ocean, airborne deposition, wastewater treatment
   facilities, automobiles, pharmaceuticals and personal care products,
   synthetic textiles, and insect repellents. Notably, secondary MPs, which
   are formed from the breakdown of larger plastic items comprise
   approximately 69-81\% of marine debris, especially in urbanized, densely
   populated areas. The inconsistencies of the methodologies (sampling,
   extraction, and quantification) and the units employed for result
   presentations are part of the major limitations in MPs research.
   Environmental phenomena such as heteroaggregation, weathering,
   adsorption, leaching, and fragmentation are the major factors
   influencing the behavior, fate, and degradation process of plastic
   particles. The physicochemical properties of plastic polymers, such as
   density, crystallinity, as well as bioturbation, meteorological forces,
   and wind actions, including currents, waves, and tides, are responsible
   for biofouling, aggregation, sinking into the bottom sediment,
   resuspension, and the vertical, horizontal, and spatiotemporal
   distributions and transport of MPs. The potential solutions to mitigate
   plastic pollution are grounded in the 3Rs framework, which includes
   reducing production and consumption, advancing the biotechnological,
   chemical and microbial development of degradable polymers, promoting
   reusable plastic products with lower environmental impacts over their
   lifetimes, and recycling waste into new products. The regulatory
   policies on single-use plastics commonly involve permanent bans and
   financial penalties for violators. In addition, nations such as the
   United States, the Netherlands, and northern Europe have introduced
   economic incentives to encourage the return of reusable materials to
   reduce plastic waste and the resulting envrionmental pollution.},

Title = {From waste to wellness - what women want: insights into patient
   perspectives on topical vaginal estrogen applicators and environmental

Abstract = {Objective Environmental consciousness and the role of plastic waste are
   increasing. Topical vaginal estrogen prescription can be prescribed with
   one reusable plastic applicator or multiple single-use plastic
   applicators. User preference about the role of plastic in personal
   healthcare is not fully understood. This study aimed to explore
   patients' perspectives on the applicator and environmental
   considerations. Method A mixed-methods questionnaire was employed to
   assess users' experience with topical vaginal estrogen applicators and
   their views on the environment. Results Ninety-two respondents had
   previously used estriol 0.1\% cream and 77 had used estradiol 10 mu g
   vaginal inserts. The mean age of participants was 67.3 years. The mean
   duration of use was 36.5 months, and the discontinuation rate was 26.1\%
   and 29.9\% for estriol 0.1\% cream and estradiol 10 mu g vaginal insert
   users, respectively. Satisfaction with applicators and ease of use were
   similar in both groups. There was a higher report of the product being
   `messy' (38.0\% vs. 18.2\%; p = 0.026) and `not hygienic' (48.9\% vs.
   18.2\%; p < 0.001) by estriol 0.1\% cream users compared to estradiol 10
   mu g vaginal insert users. Women aged <65 years demonstrated a greater
   concern about plastic use and the impact on the environment compared to
   women aged over 65 years (81.0\% vs. 56.9\%; p = 0.002). The younger
   cohort showed a preference for reusable applicators (66.2\%) compared to
   single-use applicators (33.8\%) (p = 0.005). There was no statistically
   significant difference in preference for women aged over 65 years.
   Conclusion This study demonstrates that younger postmenopausal women
   showed greater concern for plastic waste and its impact on the
   environment, with a preference for reusable products. Manufacturers of
   health products and prescribers should be aware of this growing trend.
   With similar overall satisfaction and side-effect profiles, users should
   be made aware of the different types of applicators available to help
   support an informed decision.},

   Pharmacy: A Canada-Wide Survey},
Journal = {CANADIAN JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL PHARMACY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {78},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Background: Climate change poses significant risks to both the
   environment and public health. The Canadian health care system accounts
   for an estimated 4.6\% of national carbon emissions, and hospital
   pharmacy contributes substantially to these emissions. Objectives: To
   evaluate the awareness of green initiatives and green practices in
   hospital pharmacy and to explore the overall interest of pharmacy staff
   in improving on sustainable and climate-resilient pharmacy practices.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was administered securely online to
   Canadian hospital pharmacy staff, between February 15 and April 30,
   2023. The survey contained 38 questions with specified themes related to
   sustainability and climate resilience. Results: A total of 214
   participants responded to the survey. Of these, 84\% (141/167) were
   motivated or highly motivated to engage in sustainable pharmacy
   practices. When asked about specific green initiatives planned by their
   hospital, 53\% (109/206) reported not being aware of any initiatives,
   and 10\% (20/206) indicated that no plans existed. The green practices
   that were at least partially implemented were ``reduced paper use{''}
   (27\% of responses), ``improved recycling programs{''} (18\%), and
   ``raised awareness{''} (11\%). The top 3 areas of pharmacy waste were
   identified as ``single-use plastic{''} (28\% of responses), ``excessive
   paper use{''} (18\%), and ``improper recycling{''} (17\%). The top 3
   barriers to implementing eco-friendly practices were identified as
   ``cost{''} (50\% {[}83/166]), ``time consumption{''} (50\% {[}83/166]),
   and ``added complexity{''} (30\% {[}49/166]). Conclusions: Hospital
   pharmacy staff participating in this survey study shared a willingness
   and strong motivation to engage in more sustainable and
   climate-resilient pharmacy practices, but they reported significant
   barriers, such as time consumption and perceived complexity, that must
   be addressed in implementing these changes.},

Title = {Nanoplastics from single-use polyethylene terephthalate bottles impair
   the functionality of human gut-dwelling Lactobacillus rhamnosus
   and induce toxicity in human cells},

Abstract = {Plastic pollution from single-use plastic bottles (SUPBs) generates
   micro and nanoplastics (NPs), raising concerns about their interactions
   with biological systems and potential health effects. While NPs have
   been detected in the human body, raising serious concerns about their
   possible effects on health, a clear understanding of how NPs interact
   with key biological systems in the human body is still lacking. In this
   study, NPs were synthesized from polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
   bottles to closely mimic real-world exposure. Their effects were
   investigated using a comprehensive, multi-model approach integrating
   three biologically relevant systems: Lactobacillus rhamnosus as a
   representative gut probiotic, red blood cells to assess blood
   compatibility, and A549 human epithelial cells to model general cellular
   responses. By evaluating the same nanoplastic particles across these
   systems, the study offers a realistic and mechanistic view of how such
   particles may impact human health. The synthesized PET bottle-derived
   NPs (PBNPs), ranging from 50 to 850 nm, closely mimicked naturally
   occurring environmental NPs. Exposure to PBNPs led to a dose- and
   time-dependent reduction in L. rhamnosus viability, with pronounced
   effects after 16 days. Growth kinetics revealed impaired proliferation
   at higher concentrations, and confocal microscopy confirmed membrane
   damage. PBNPs also reduced antioxidant activity, antibacterial activity
   and increased biofilm formation, autoaggregation, and antibiotic
   sensitivity. Adhesion assays showed reduced bacterial attachment to
   colon epithelial cells, indicating disrupted colonization. Gene
   expression analysis reflected oxidative stress responses, while
   metabolomic profiling revealed alterations in energy, amino acid, and
   membrane lipid metabolism. In RBCs, PBNP exposure at higher
   concentrations induced morphological changes consistent with membrane
   destabilization, indicating potential hemolytic toxicity. In A549 cells,
   short-term exposure showed minimal effects, but prolonged exposure led
   to reduced viability, accompanied by DNA damage and increased expression
   of apoptotic, oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers. Metabolomic
   profiling revealed alterations in glucose metabolism, amino acid
   balance, and lipid-associated pathways. Ames testing showed no direct
   mutagenicity, but metabolic activation increased mutagenic potential,
   suggesting bioactivation-dependent genotoxicity. These findings
   demonstrate how real-world NPs can impair probiotic function, damage
   blood cells, and induce cellular toxicity, underscoring the need for
   deeper mechanistic understanding and appropriate regulatory strategies.},

Title = {A Review of Hawaii and Plastic Pollution: Potential Innovations within
   Circular Economy?},

Abstract = {The study presents a comprehensive literature review focused on the
   impacts of plastic pollution within the Hawaiian ocean ecosystem. The
   analysis is organized into three primary sections to facilitate a
   structured understanding of the issue. First, the research identifies
   and categorizes the various types of plastics that contribute to
   pollution in the marine environment. This includes an exploration of
   single-use plastics, microplastics, and abandoned fishing gear, among
   others, each presenting unique challenges to marine ecosystems. Second,
   the review investigates the multifaceted effects of these plastics on
   the ocean ecosystem. It examines how plastics, particularly fishing nets
   and microplastics, have become prevalent elements of marine debris. The
   literature highlights the intricate ways plastics interact with marine
   life, including ingestion by various species, entanglement of wildlife,
   and the introduction of hazardous chemicals that can leach into the
   ocean. These interactions can lead to significant adverse effects on
   biodiversity, disrupt food chains, and pose health risks to human
   populations reliant on marine resources. Third, the paper advocates for
   the adoption of a circular economy approach as a strategic framework to
   mitigate the widespread impacts of plastic pollution. It outlines
   innovative recycling methods, the reduction of plastic production, and
   the promotion of sustainable alternatives as potential solutions. The
   findings from the literature review indicate that marine debris,
   particularly fishing nets, are the most frequently reported items,
   emphasizing the need for targeted interventions in these areas.
   Moreover, the study reveals that marine debris often interacts with
   hazardous chemicals, exacerbating the detrimental effects on both marine
   biodiversity and human health. Interestingly, it notes that while the
   presence of plastics can create slicks that might have certain benefits,
   such as providing microhabitats for some species, these benefits are
   overshadowed by the overall negative impacts on ecosystems.
   Additionally, the study discusses the role of wind energy factors in
   dispersing debris patches identified throughout the Pacific Ocean,
   illustrating the complex dynamics at play in oceanic pollution. While
   the paper proposes various sustainable innovations aimed at addressing
   the plastic crisis, it emphasizes the necessity for further research to
   thoroughly evaluate the feasibility and resilience of these proposed
   solutions. This call for more in-depth studies aims to ensure that the
   strategies developed are both practical and effective in restoring and
   preserving the Hawaiian ocean ecosystem amidst ongoing challenges posed
   by plastic pollution.},

   and pathways to sustainability},
Journal = {INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 SEP 20},
Abstract = {This review revisits microplastic pollution in Bangladesh from
   2014-2024, synthesizing research on distribution, plastic types,
   policies, and mitigation strategies. Using PubMed and Google Scholar,
   peer-reviewed articles and documents were analyzed to assess sources,
   impacts, and policy effectiveness. Microplastics contaminate rivers,
   soil, air, fertilizers, and food products. The dominant polymers,
   including polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene
   terephthalate, and polyamide, originate from fishing nets, industrial
   discharge, and urban waste, threatening ecosystems and food chains.
   Plastic pollution is exacerbated by transboundary river systems,
   excessive plastic production, use of single-use plastics, and
   ineffective waste management. The Meghna, Karnaphuli, and Rupsha Rivers
   transport 1 million metric tons of mismanaged waste annually to coastal
   areas. The plastics industry, employing 1.2 million people across 5,000
   manufacturers, has increased per capita plastic consumption from 3 kg in
   2005 to 9 kg in 2020, worsening waste accumulation. The COVID-19
   pandemic accelerated the crisis, with polythene bag usage increasing to
   21 billion, generating 78,433 tons of waste. Plastic pollution costs USD
   39 million annually, affecting tourism, fisheries, and municipal
   budgets, and microplastic contamination threatens seafood exports.
   Clean-up costs consume 30\% of Bangladesh's environmental budget. Using
   an agent-based system dynamics model, simulations predict that per
   capita plastic waste will rise to 11.6 kg by 2040, with landfill
   accumulation reaching 70,000 tons and riverine discharge increasing from
   512 to 834 tons, raising the plastic waste footprint index (PWFI) to 24.
   Policy 2, which implements 69\% conversion, 80\% source separation, and
   50\% riverine discharge reduction, proves most effective, lowering PWFI
   to 1.07 and ensuring sustainable waste management. However, an
   integrated approach combining research, policy enforcement,
   technological innovation, and global collaboration is crucial.
   Strengthening the waste management framework, regulatory enforcement,
   and sustainable economic strategies will enable Bangladesh to mitigate
   microplastic pollution, advance its circular economy, and contribute to
   global environmental conservation.
   Key points Microplastic pollution in Bangladesh is contaminating rivers,
   soil, air, and food products, with the primary polymers involved, such
   as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate,
   and polyamide, significantly affecting both ecosystems and food
   chainsPlastic waste costs Bangladesh USD 39 million annually, affecting
   tourism, fisheries, and municipal budgets, and clean-up costs strain
   resources.Poor enforcement and ineffective waste management cause
   plastic accumulation in landfills and waterways, worsening urban
   flooding and increasing health risks.A 69\% conversion rate, 80\% source
   separation, and 50\% reduction in riverine discharge, as outlined in
   Policy 2, were identified as the most effective methods for lowering the
   plastic waste footprint and advancing sustainable waste management and
   Bangladesh's circular economy.},

Abstract = {Plastic pollution has escalated into a global crisis, undermining both
   environmental sustainability and public health. Each year, nearly eight
   billion tons of plastic enter aquatic ecosystems, disrupting marine
   biodiversity and increasing risks of human exposure to toxic byproducts.
   As plastics degrade, they release hazardous compounds such as bisphenol
   A (BPA), dioxins, phthalates, furans, and heavy metals-substances linked
   to respiratory illnesses, endocrine disruption, and cancer. These
   pollutants find pathways into the environment through soil leaching, air
   transport, and bioaccumulation across the food chain. Alarming data
   points highlight the gravity of the issue: BPA concentrations in
   freshwater bodies have exceeded 12 mu g L-1, and dioxin levels near open
   waste combustion sites have reached over 1000 ng TEQ per kg both
   surpassing WHO's safety thresholds. In Poland, phthalate levels in
   leachate from landfills have been recorded at more than 303 mu g L-1,
   while fish specimens from Swedish waters have shown heavy metal
   concentrations more than 2.26 ng g-1 moist weight, raising potential
   food safety hazards and chronic exposure risks. Ineffective trash
   disposal infrastructure disproportionately affects vulnerable
   communities in countries with low to middle-incomes (LMICs), especially
   in Sub-Saharan Africa, where only 39-45\% of solid waste is adequately
   treated due to infrastructural and financial limitations. The problem is
   most severe in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the most vulnerable people are
   at the greatest risk of exposure. On a global scale, effective recycling
   remains minimal, with less than 10\% of plastic waste being repurposed.
   Most of it is incinerated or dumped, releasing hazardous emissions such
   as dioxins and furans into the environment. Emerging technologies offer
   promising but underutilized solutions. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
   can be recovered up to 97\% using chemical recycling processes and
   enzymatic procedures have demonstrated plastic breakdown efficiencies as
   high as 90\% within hours. However, challenges remain in scaling these
   technologies due to high costs, limited infrastructure, and uneven
   access in LMICs. Policy interventions have shown strong results in some
   nations. By enforcing restrictions on single-use plastics and applying
   expanded producer responsibility (EPR) frameworks, countries such as
   Germany, Japan, and Rwanda have achieved recycling rates above 41\% and
   reduced plastic waste generation by up to 90\%. These cases demonstrate
   the role of governance, regulatory enforcement, and accountability in
   driving systemic change. Addressing plastic pollution globally requires
   coordinated action, including strict regulations, investment in scalable
   recycling systems, promotion of eco-friendly alternatives, and stronger
   international cooperation. Only through such combined and
   multi-dimensional approaches can the growing environmental and public
   health risks of plastic waste be effectively reduced.},

Abstract = {Background: Most guidelines recommend use of sterile water in single-use
   plastic bottles for irrigation in colonoscopy, a recommendation
   extrapolated from case reports of infection linked to endoscopic
   retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Our objective was to identify
   evidence exploring the impact of tap versus sterile water in colonoscopy
   on patient, health care resource, and environmental outcomes.Methods: We
   performed a scoping review and included any study examining the effects
   of irrigation source during colonoscopy. A health information specialist
   searched Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science from inception to
   March 2024 using Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies standards.
   Two reviewers performed screening and data extraction using a
   standardized form. We conducted a quantitative analysis of patient
   outcomes.Results: Of 335 identified articles, we included 3. All were
   prospective studies published between 1996 and 2002. Overall, 137
   colonoscopies and 38 flexible sigmoidoscopies were reported. Two studies
   compared sterile versus tap water, with 7 of 118 (6\%) and 35 of 327
   (11\%) positive water cultures, respectively. There were no clinical
   adverse events. One study compared tap water at warm versus room
   temperature and measured patient pain scores (2/10 and 4/10,
   respectively). Infectious complications were not reported.Conclusion:
   There is limited evidence to support either tap or sterile water in
   irrigation for colonoscopy, but potable tap water may be a safe choice
   and is environmentally and economically more beneficial than sterile
   water. In the context of the climate crisis and increasing economic
   health care burden, tap water in reusable bottles should be strongly
   considered for irrigation in colonoscopy. Registration: Open Science
