Abstract = {Single-use plastics are often used once or cannot be reused for extended
   periods. They are widely consumed with the rapid development of social
   economy. The waste generated by single-use plastics threatens ecosystem
   health by entering the environment and ultimately restricts sustainable
   human development. The innovation of sustainable and environmentally
   friendly single-use plastic alternative materials and the joint
   participation of governments, enterprises and the public are promising
   technologies and management approaches that can solve the problem of
   single-use plastics wastes. The development of single-use plastic
   alternative products can be promoted fundamentally only by improving
   relevant legislation and standards, providing differentiated industrial
   policies, encouraging scientific and technological innovation and
   expanding public participation.},

Title = {Intrinsic motivation for reducing single-use plastics: The compensation
   effects of basic psychological needs},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {185},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Increasing single-use plastic consumption has caused tremendous
   consequences for the ecosystem; therefore, consumers are being
   encouraged to reduce this. Despite numerous research about single-use
   plastics, we still have little understanding into how individuals'
   intrinsic motivation for less single-use plastics can be developed. This
   study extends the self-determination theory about human motivation and
   the functioning of basic psychological needs which are essential for
   behavior change to study how three basic psychological needs can
   influence intrinsic motivation for reducing single-use plastics. Also,
   the negative interaction effects of each pair of basic psychological
   needs on intrinsic motivation were examined in this study. A sample of
   468 responses collected in a stated preference survey was used to test
   the theoretical framework. Findings reveal that intrinsic motivation for
   reducing single-use plastics can be influenced by the satisfaction of
   basic psychological needs. Interestingly, the research has extended the
   self-determination theory by highlighting compensation effects among the
   fulfillment of basic psychological needs on intrinsic motivation for
   reducing single-use plastics.},

Title = {Current situation and key challenges on the use of single-use plastic in
   Hanoi},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {121},

Abstract = {Marine plastic litter, mostly comprising single-use plastics, has been
   recognised as one of the world's most urgent environmental concerns, and
   Vietnam has been ranked as one of the top five countries polluting the
   ocean with plastic waste. This paper examines Hanoi as a case study on
   single-use plastic by households, investigating the daily generation of
   single-use plastic waste through a survey, assessing existing policy
   gaps through a policy review, and providing recommendations on improving
   management along the supply chain in Vietnam. At almost 27 times a week
   on average, plastic shopping bags were found to be the most prevalent
   single-use plastic used by households, followed by wrap/film, straws,
   coffee cups with plastic lids, cutlery, takeout containers, food
   packaging, party cups, bottles for water and beverages, and other items.
   Plastic shopping bags and food packaging are used more often in rural
   areas than in urban areas. These bags also have a high rate (68.65\%) of
   temporary reuse as kitchen bin liners, a habit that may be difficult to
   change over the short term. Apart from some components of plastic
   bottles and packaging that are sold for recycling, most single-use
   plastic waste is disposed in landfills. Policies are in place to address
   plastic issues, such as a tax on plastic bags and source separation, but
   implementation is inconsistent. A behaviour-based combination of
   top-town and bottom-up approaches along the entire supply chain is
   recommended to improve existing policy gaps in Vietnam. (C) 2021

Title = {Policy responses to reduce single-use plastic marine pollution in the
   Caribbean},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {162},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Caribbean economies depend heavily on a healthy marine ecosystem, but
   the region includes ten of the top global marine polluters per capita.
   Regional marine pollution is driven by illegal plastic waste dumping due
   to poor waste management systems with limited recycling, and weak
   enforcement. Governments recognize the impacts of marine debris on their
   social and economic well-being and have responded with policies to curb
   plastic pollution. Most focus on bans of single-use plastic and
   polystyrene, which comprises similar to 80\% of Caribbean marine litter.
   However, there is little comparative analysis of policy responses to
   determine their efficacy. This paper reviews current policies in 13
   English-speaking Caribbean countries, exploring tools used and process
   of implementation. Eleven have introduced legislative policies, with
   seven including fines and penalties for non-compliance. All successful
   policies involve multiple tools, including primary stakeholder
   engagement, sufficient lead time between policy announcement and
   implementation, and extensive public education campaigns.},

   among the Youth in Nairobi, Kenya},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Kenya has made many attempts to regulate the production of single-use
   plastics through partial bans and the imposition of hefty taxes. Whereas
   government initiatives are crucial to resolving single-use plastic
   pollution, commitments made by youths can be an important part of the
   solution. Yet, youths are habituated to using single-use plastics
   without understanding fully their negative impacts. Understanding the
   knowledge and attitudes of youths is of the utmost importance in the
   effort to turn the tide against plastic pollution. This study set out to
   investigate knowledge and attitudes towards single-use plastics among
   youths in Nairobi, Kenya. This was a mixed study approach, where both
   qualitative and quantitative data were derived. The results showed that
   youths perceive single-use plastics as a serious environmental and
   health issue. Most respondents expressed willingness to switch to
   reusable alternatives if provided with financial incentives. In
   addition, the results showed stronger support for enhanced awareness
   campaigns and plastic recycling infrastructure. Social media was the
   most preferred channel to disseminate plastic pollution messaging among
   the youth. These findings are important in policy development for
   intensifying awareness and targeting a range of communication and
   financial support to reduce single-use plastic pollution.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the knowledge and attitudes of the Greek public
   towards marine plastic pollution and the EU Single-Use Plastics
   Directive by interpreting the results of a questionnaire. In Greece, the
   issue of marine plastic pollution has been highlighted by scientists.
   Public consultation processes about the implementation of the Directive
   into the national law have been also carried out. However, the results
   of our study showed that participants were not informed about the issue
   of marine plastic pollution nor the EU Single-Use Plastics Directive.
   Nevertheless, they expressed positive attitudes towards it including
   their willingness to pay and act in order to reduce their plastic waste.
   Thereby, it is recommended that more initiatives should support the
   publicity of the Directive so that the Greek public would be able to
   participating in the decision-making process and support its
   implementation. In addition, the current study suggests that the topic
   of microplastics should be integrated into the context of formal
   education.},

Title = {Exploring consumer single-use plastic reduction behaviour: A conceptual
   framework},

Abstract = {Single-use plastics waste, when not properly managed and discarded,
   poses a threat to both the environment and human health. In the next 30
   years, the global plastics waste crisis will exacerbate if the current
   consumption pattern and their production continue. The plastics crisis
   is seen as an anthropocentric problem that requires the understanding of
   consumer consumption patterns in order to encourage its alleviation.
   Thus, this paper proposes a conceptual framework to examine the
   predictors for adopting single-use plastics reduction activities among
   young urban consumers in Malaysia. Rather than assuming the homogeneity
   of the consumer's single-use plastics reduction pattern, the current
   framework posits that different consumers are at different stages of
   behavioural readiness and adoption. It also explores the underlying
   factors and specific social referent groups at each stage using the
   integration of the Transtheoretical Model and Theory of Planned
   Behaviour. Consumer segmentation based on the theoretical integration
   could be used to create a more targeted behavioural change efforts that
   align with the characteristics and drivers of each stage. It is hoped
   that the present research can help to support efforts in reducing
   single-use plastics as outlined in the Malaysia's Roadmap towards Zero
   Single-Use Plastics 2018-2030 policy.},

Abstract = {One of the challenging tasks for governments is to curtail the
   production and consumption of single-use plastic bags. Despite multiple
   advantages of plastic and its ubiquity, the environmental damage of
   single-use plastic bags is irreversible. However, policy intervention by
   the governments is also a need of the time to reduce its production and
   consumption. This study provides a strategic analysis of government
   policy options regarding the ban on single-use plastic production in
   Pakistan. A game-theoretic model is developed to examine the behavior of
   plastic bag producers vis-a-vis the government's climate change policy.
   The study concludes that game theory is very effective in analyzing the
   efficient promulgation and productive implementation of environmental
   management policy regarding banning single-use plastic in Pakistan.

Title = {Single-use plastic packaging in the Canadian food industry: consumer
   behavior and perceptions},
Journal = {HUMANITIES \& SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Single-use plastic food packaging is a major contributor to the global
   solid waste problem. Although the food industry is developing strategies
   to reduce single-use plastic packaging, it needs to better understand
   consumer awareness and attitudes about the issue. As consumer awareness
   about single-use plastic waste outpaces private sector practices, this
   study considered personal motivation factors, government policies, and
   innovative solutions related to single-use plastic food packaging. This
   Canada-wide study surveyed 1014 consumers and their willingness to pay
   premiums for sustainable food packaging alternatives and motivations to
   reduce single-use plastic waste. Overwhelmingly, most (93.7\%)
   respondents were personally motivated to reduce consumption of
   single-use plastic food packaging. Canadians were highly motivated to
   reduce single-use plastic food packaging, but less willing to pay for
   sustainable alternatives. While environmental concerns were more
   critical than food safety, Canadians acknowledged that sustainable
   packaging alternatives were more desirable than outright plastic bag
   bans, despite not willing to pay for them. Using approaches that
   consider multiple driving factors on consumer behavior and opinions
   towards use of single-use plastic food packaging, limitations,
   recommendations and future research are proposed.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastic consumption is at an all-time high and threatens
   environmental and human health. College campuses in particular serve as
   a hub for single-use plastics due to their convenience for students on
   the go. The present research tests whether social comparison information
   can influence self-perceptions of single-use plastic consumption and
   motivate behavior change within the college campus environment. In a
   controlled experiment, we measured college students' existing plastic
   water bottle usage and gave them false feedback about their behaviors
   and relative standing to their classmates: participants in comparison
   conditions learned they were either above or below average in their
   plastic water bottle sustainability behaviors. Results indicated that
   (relative to a no-comparison control), being above average at water
   bottle sustainability led students to be more satisfied with their
   sustainability efforts. However, either kind of comparison information
   (i.e., being above or below average) led to greater behavioral
   intentions to reduce single-use plastic water bottle consumption in the
   future. This study highlights how comparison information can be used to
   motivate sustainable behavior change with regards to single-use
   plastics.</p>},

   Food Delivery Business in Thailand},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Sustainable consumption and production (SCP) is largely influenced by
   dynamics in the market system. Hence, this study adopts the systems
   thinking approach as a tool to understand the non-linearity and
   complexity of sustainable practices. The food delivery business has
   accelerated the plastic waste problem, especially during COVID-19 where
   restaurant dine-in was limited. This study aims to identify high
   leverage points, which contribute to system intervention strategies to
   improve Thailand's single-use plastics (SUP) waste situation caused by
   the food delivery sector. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with
   relevant stakeholders (n = 14). A qualitative system dynamics model
   analysis and thematic analysis suggest that the key leverage points
   include (1) benefit alignment among all stakeholders, (2) cost
   minimization and profit maximization, (3) laws and regulations, (4)
   postconsumption waste management systems, and (5) research and
   development. In addition, to stimulate policy initiatives, this study
   suggests that system intervention strategies should include behavioral
   instruments (setting default and eco-labelling), market-based
   instruments (green-packaging procurement and subsidies), and system and
   infrastructure provision (waste management systems and deposit return
   models). Partnerships, research and development, and laws and
   regulations are proposed as supporting measures.},

Title = {Is It All About the Data? How Extruded Polystyrene Escaped Single-Use
   Plastic Directive Market Restrictions},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Month = {FEB 14},
Abstract = {The Single-Use Plastics Directive (EU) 72/2019/904 is the main
   legislation governing plastic pollution, inclusive of marine plastic
   pollution in the European Union (EU). The Directive has issued market
   restrictions on several single-use plastic products which contribute to
   marine plastic pollution, including foamed polystyrene products made of
   expanded polystyrene (EPS). However, extruded polystyrene (XPS) which is
   commonly used in the same single-use plastics products as EPS has been
   omitted from the market placement restrictions within the scope of the
   Directive. This has subsequently compromised the Single-Use Plastics
   Directive's effectiveness for reducing marine plastic pollution and
   hinders the efforts of related EU instruments such as the Marine
   Strategy Framework Directive, Descriptor 10 toward achieving Good
   Environmental Status across the marine environment in the EU. This paper
   provides some background on EPS and XPS, and discusses plastic pollution
   policy making in the EU, while further addressing the role of
   quantitative data in the European Joint Research Centre's Technical
   Report on Top Marine Beach Litter Items in the EU for the formulation of
   policy regulating foamed polystyrene derived marine plastic pollution.
   We also provide an overview of how the communication gaps in the polymer
   science nomenclature for polystyrene may have contributed to the
   development of misnomers for extruded and EPS, consequently compromising
   necessary data gathering efforts. Our perspective hopes to incite
   conversations on communication gaps between scientists and policy makers
   and emphasise the need for gathering quantitative disaggregated data on
   the foamed polystyrene market to inform European plastic pollution
   legislation adequately.},

Abstract = {Interest in circular economy practices is increasing. A key material
   that connects the circular economy and wider environmental concerns is
   plastic waste, which poses environmental, climate, and human health
   risks. Single-use plastic packaging is particularly problematic because
   it forms the largest share of the global plastics market, has a short
   life cycle, and has channelled investment towards the bottom of the
   waste hierarchy. Given single-use plastic packaging is embedded in
   global trade, transitioning away from use requires much more than
   `behaviour change' from individual producers and consumers. In this
   article we use social practice theory to show how social change is
   occurring with regard to single-use plastics. We draw on two food retail
   case studies of (primarily) business-to-consumer packaging from Aotearoa
   New Zealand. We show how transitioning away from single-use plastic food
   packaging requires (1) understanding the function and meaning of
   packaging materials, and (2) coordinating other materials, skills and
   meanings to re-craft and substitute the functions that single-use
   packaging performs across businesses, supply chains and consumers. Our
   analysis illustrates the significant collaboration and emerging networks
   needed for change, and signals how investment towards the top of the
   waste hierarchy in reuse could contribute to a more circular economy.},

Abstract = {This study aims to analyze plastic bag usage by households before and
   after plastic bag fees were implemented in Turkey in terms of
   socio-demographic factors, attitude toward the policy, and environmental
   awareness. Single-use plastic bags, which cannot be broken down in
   nature for long periods of time, are the type of plastic products with
   the most widespread and rapid consumption. Many countries and regions in
   the world have been trying to change consumers' shopping culture habits
   through bans and taxes on plastic bags. In Turkey, the practice of
   offering plastic bags free of charge was banned as of 2019. In this
   study, gender, age, education level, marital status, employment status
   and income level were considered as socio-demographic factors. Using
   survey data from 789 people residing in Istanbul, a principal component
   analysis and a logistic regression analysis were employed in this study.
   Results indicated that environmental awareness and various
   socio-demographic factors such as gender, marital status, income level,
   employment status influenced the use of paid and free-of-charge plastic
   bag use. However, age and level of education from the socio-demographic
   factors were not correlated with plastic bag usage before and after the
   introduction of the fee.},

Title = {Carbon Footprint of Single-Use Plastic Items and Their Substitution},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Single-use plastic is having a significant environmental impact and its
   reduction is a mandatory step to reduce plastic pollution worldwide.
   Indeed, the time that a plastic item can persist in the environment is
   very long and it is well known that it can produce devastating effects
   in particular in seas and oceans. Moreover, production, use and disposal
   of plastic items have a significant impact also on the greenhouse
   effect; this can be estimated in a life cycle approach, by evaluating
   their carbon footprint. In this work, a review of the carbon footprint
   evaluation of different single-use plastic categories has been carried
   out, developing a methodology to immediately evaluate the benefits
   related to their substitution with compostable and bio-plastic and/or
   multiple-use items and materials. The result of the novel methodology
   developed is a certain number of matrixes, which can categorize impact
   values in order to compare them with replacement with bio-based plastic
   materials or multi-use things. Finally, the methodology was tested and
   validated through a case study, where a plastic reduction plan was
   proposed and implemented and the CO2 equivalent reduction was assessed,
   demonstrating a reduction potential related to a replacement by
   bioplastic or other materials equal, respectively, to 73\% and 90\%.},

Abstract = {Though rational and moral antecedents to tourists' pro-environmental
   behavioral intentions have been separately established, the literature
   remains inconclusive on whether tourists' pro-environmental intentions
   are underpinned by rational or moral considerations. Based on the theory
   of planned behavior and the norm activation model, this study examines
   the competing rational and moral antecedents of intention to use
   reusable alternatives to single-use plastics using data obtained from
   653 tourists and analyzed with the structural equation modeling. The
   results indicate that though morality better explained the intention to
   use reusable alternatives to single-use plastics amongst all tourists,
   rationality underpinned the intention amongst domestic tourists while
   morality better explained the intentions of international tourists. The
   implications of these findings regarding future theorization of
   tourists' pro-environmental behavior and measures to reduce single-use
   plastic marine pollution in coastal destinations are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to determine the knowledge, readiness, and barriers
   among street food hawkers to support the single-use plastic reduction
   program. A cross-sectional study was performed involving 440 night
   market food street hawkers from five districts in Kelantan, Malaysia
   selected through proportionate random sampling from 17 night market
   locations. The majority of the respondents had good knowledge level,
   60\% of respondents were ready to support this program, and 73\% of them
   responded that barriers had low influence on them. Social media was the
   most popular information source utilized to obtain plastic usage
   information. Age, readiness to change, and significant barriers, were
   found to be associated with better knowledge. Male food hawkers and food
   hawkers that received information from social media and official sources
   were more ready to support single-use plastic reduction program. Proper
   strategies which incorporate more environmental knowledge, identify, and
   address the barriers may enhance the readiness to support this
   pro-environmental behaviour.},

Abstract = {Plastic waste has gained global attention due to growing concerns about
   its impact on human and environmental health. More than 50\% of
   manufactured plastics are disposed of after single-use, leading to 150
   million tons of annual plastic waste worldwide. Although numerous
   efforts are underway to replace single-use plastic straws with
   alternative products to reduce environmental pollution, their potential
   impact on the environment, economy, and society is yet to be analyzed.
   This study considers plastic straws as an exemplar that captures the
   evolution of plastic use, its persisting problems, on-going efforts and
   advances in single-use plastic waste management, and the search for
   viable alternatives. We use the key principles of sustainability to
   explore the environmental, economic, and social impacts of different
   types of straw. In doing this, we contrast how producing drinking straws
   with (bio)materials could reduce their ecological impact, improve waste
   management. Additionally, we evaluate alternative approaches that have
   the potential to include straws within a broader ``circular economy{''}
   strategy. However, alternative ways of producing straws only provide a
   partial solution. A broader beneficial effect on the environment will
   only be attained through consumer acceptance and behavioral changes. Any
   shift to resolve the persisting issues surrounding single-use plastics
   must be done from a systems approach to sustainability in order to
   mitigate environmental and economic risks and their rebound effects on
   the society.},

Abstract = {Society-level discourse on single-use plastics (SUPs) increases
   awareness of their negative envi-ronmental impacts and reduces their
   usage by environmentally aware individuals, firms, and gov-ernments.
   This article makes a unique and timely contribution to the literature by
   exploring why conference venues have not been proactive in reducing
   their usage of SUPs. Application of a ques-tionnaire approach to collect
   primary data about venues' attitudes and practices towards their level
   and reduction in usage of SUPs reveals that although venues claim to be
   motivated to reduce del-egates' use of SUPs, they state that excessive
   costs inhibit their ability to do so, and that legal and government
   regulations have the strongest influence on their use of SUPs. Our
   findings provide a frame of reference and an order of policy priority to
   ensure SUPs reduction by venues.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {96210-96220},
Abstract = {The boom in online food delivery(OFD) platforms brings convenience to
   both consumers and restaurants but leads to pollution from
   nonbiodegradable plastic food containers. To reduce pollution, the
   Chinese government enacted a ban on using multiple single-use plastics,
   including nondegradable OFD food containers. There may be various
   interests involved in enforcing the ban, so careful analysis is required
   before implementing the ban. This study applied evolutionary game theory
   to examine the interaction mechanism of the problematic behaviors
   between OFD platforms and restaurants. By theoretical research and
   simulation, we analyzed the conditions under which the game can converge
   to the expected outcome. In addition, we discussed the measures that are
   most important to promote restaurants using degradable food packaging in
   their service.},

Abstract = {Globally, universities, institutions, and companies are aiming to reduce
   the use of single-use plastics as plastic litter, and plastic
   degradation generates secondary microplastics, all of which cause
   negative impacts on the environment. In this study the authors conducted
   a questionnaire-based survey to assess the willingness and motivation of
   stakeholders within academic settings to change daily habits to minimize
   plastic and microplastic pollution. The questionnaire, which was
   answered by 276 individuals with affiliation to the American Farm School
   or collaborating academic institutions, but primarily the American Farm
   School, was used to draw conclusions. Results showed that most
   stakeholders are ready to adapt to eliminate the use of single-use
   plastic within their institution and showed a high level of willingness
   to participate in cleaning campaigns. It is crucial to combine any new
   measures or policies with the proper education around why these measures
   are being enforced, so as to raise awareness and receptivity to those
   that are not familiar with microplastics and microplastic pollution.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastics (SUPs) represent a major threat to marine
   environments and require proactive policies to reduce consumption and
   mismanagement. Many SUP management strategies exist to reduce SUP use
   and mitigate environmental impacts, including extended producer
   responsibility (EPR), deposit-return schemes, SUP bans or taxes, and
   public outreach and education. This study analyzed brand audit and beach
   cleanup data in four densely populated Canadian cities (Vancouver,
   Toronto, Montre ` al, Halifax) and a remote island (Sable Island) to
   determine efficacy of ongoing SUP mitigation measures. Cities were found
   to have similar litter type proportions, and six brands were found to
   disproportionally contribute to Canadian SUP litter, comprising 39\% of
   branded litter collected. Results confirm that current Canadian SUP
   management appears to be insufficient to address leakage of SUPs into
   the environment. Recommendations to strengthen SUP management strategies
   and mitigate plastic pollution are recommended to improve future
   Canadian SUP reduction policies.},

Abstract = {Plastic pollution negatively affects ecosystems and human health
   globally, with single-use plastic representing the majority of marine
   litter in some areas. Life science laboratories prefer pristine
   conditions for experimental reliability and therefore make use of
   factory standardized single-use plastic products. This contributes to
   overall plastic waste in the United States and globally. Here, we
   investigate the potential of reusing plastic culture dishes and
   subsequently propose methods to mitigate single-use plastic waste in
   developmental biology research laboratories. We tested the efficacy of
   bleach and ethyl alcohol in sterilizing used dishes. We then tested the
   feasibility of washing and reusing plastic to culture Xenopus laevis
   embryos subjected to various manipulations. Cleaning and reusing
   laboratory plastic did not affect the development or survival of X.
   laevis, indicating that these cleaning methods do not adversely affect
   experimental outcome and can be used to sterilize plastic before reuse
   or recycling. Lastly, we performed a survey of various life science
   laboratories to estimate both waste reduction and savings associated
   with recycling single-use plastics. Standardization of these procedures
   would allow research laboratories to benefit economically while
   practicing environmentally conscious consumption.},

Title = {A review of biodegradable thermoplastic starches, their blends and
   composites: recent developments and opportunities for single-use plastic
   packaging alternatives},

Abstract = {Single-use plastic packaging has become an inevitable part of every
   aspect of human life. In fact, the increase in the consumption of
   petroleum-based single-use plastics has resulted in the accumulation of
   municipal solid wastes which are a leading source of plastic pollution
   worldwide. Biobased materials are a virtuous replacement for single-use
   petroleum-based packaging products, when recycling is difficult or not
   practical, to fulfil environmental and economic demands. Starch is an
   abundant biobased polymeric material that is sustainable and
   biodegradable. However, the inefficiency of starch in processability due
   to the existence of hydrogen bonding interactions and intermolecular
   forces impedes its applications. An effective solution is plasticization
   of starch in the presence of heat and shear, and is termed plasticized
   starch (PS). Although different sources may refer to plasticized starch
   (PS) as thermoplastic starch (TPS), the plasticization process does not
   make the starch a thermoplastic material until it is blended with
   toughened polymer, making the nomenclature counterintuitive. TPS is
   procured through the process of plasticization of starch with water and
   plasticizers followed by blending with tougher polymers/biopolymers.
   This could enhance the flexibility and processability of the blend
   materials, which are an effective replacement for petroleum-based
   single-use plastic packaging. In this review the main focus is on
   analysing the effect of multiple plasticizers and compatibility
   enhancers such as compatibilizers, coupling agents and essential oils in
   TPS blends, and starch-based composites' preparation and their effective
   use in single-use packaging applications. Global production and market
   analysis of thermoplastic starches and their challenges in real-life
   packaging applications are also discussed.},

Title = {Single-use plastic and COVID-19 in the NHS: Barriers and opportunities},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Background: Single-use personal protective equipment (PPE) has been
   essential to protect healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   However, intensified use of PPE could counteract the previous efforts
   made by the UK NHS Trusts to reduce their plastic footprint.
   Design and methods: In this study, we conducted an in-depth case study
   in the Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust to investigate plastic-related
   issues in a typical NHS Trust before, during and after the pandemic. We
   first collected hospital routine data on both procurement and usage of
   single-use PPE (including face masks, aprons, and gowns) for the time
   period between April 2019 and August 2020. We then interviewed 12
   hospital staff across a wide remit, from senior managers to consultants,
   nurses and catering staff, to gather qualitative evidence on the overall
   impact of COVID-19 on the Trust regarding plastic use.
   Results: We found that although COVID-19 had increased the procurement
   and the use of single-use plastic substantially during the pandemic, it
   did not appear to have changed the focus of the hospital on implementing
   measures to reduce single-use plastic in the long term. We then
   discussed the barriers and opportunities to tackle plastic issues within
   the NHS in the post-COVID world, for example, a circular healthcare
   model.
   Conclusion: Investment is needed in technologies and processes that can
   recycle and reuse a wider range of single-use plastics, and innovate
   sustainable alternatives to replace singleuse consumables used in the
   NHS to construct a fully operational closed material loop healthcare
   system.},

Abstract = {The present study evaluates the Pan-India beach litter density
   (items/m(2)), weight (kg/m(2)), composition (\%), and probable sources
   based on the citizen science approach. A total of 33 beaches in 2019 and
   30 beaches in 2021 were studied. Based on density, the national beach
   litter average was 0.475 +/- 0.51 and 0.3 +/- 0.4 items/m(2) in 2019 and
   2021, respectively. Plastic was the dominant litter type (65 \% in 2019;
   74 \% in 2021) and Single-Use Plastics (SUPs) were predominant. Based on
   Clean-Coast Index, six beaches in 2019 and three beaches in 2021 are
   classified as ``extremely dirty{''}. The principal (similar to 60 \%)
   sources of litter were tourism and public littering. Improving solid
   waste management, stringent implementation of environmental legislation,
   leveraging the polluter pays principle, monitoring the effectiveness of
   SUPs ban, generating awareness, and beach clean-up at regular intervals
   by engaging the public, educational, and non-governmental organizations
   will improve and sustain the cleanliness of beaches.},

Abstract = {Plastic pollution is ubiquitous in the environment. One initiative that
   tackles this global environmental problem is the ``Plastic Free
   July,{''} a worldwide campaign encouraging consumers to reduce their
   single-use plastic consumption during the month of July. In the current
   study, we investigate microblogging in order to analyze the messages
   people spread within the scope of the campaign. This paper presents
   results of a Twitter analysis based on data from July 2018, assessing
   16,363 tweets linked to the hashtag \#plasticfreejuly. User structure
   shows that private individuals and shops frequently used this hashtag.
   Simultaneously, a content analysis reveals that consumption patterns
   mentioned in the tweets refer not only to boycott (e.g. avoidance of
   plastic straws) but also to buycott (e.g. praising reusable coffee cups)
   as forms of political consumption. The three R's of waste management -
   reduce, reuse, recycle - were frequently mentioned in the tweets. Thus,
   the empowerment of consumers was promoted by solution-based rather than
   problem-based communication.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastics (SUP) coming from the land represent a large
   fraction of marine plastic debris that threatens the ocean biota today
   and are one of the main causes of microplastic pollution. Consumer
   behavior is essential to stop the use and improper disposal of SUP,
   replacing plastic with alternative eco-friendly products. For the
   evident plastic pollution of beaches and seas, marine citizenship,
   interpreted as the personal responsibility that individuals take for the
   oceans, could help to reduce SUP use and change to sustainable
   alternatives. Here we studied SUP consumption behaviors in Spain (n =
   585) and Mexico (n = 337) using a multivariate multiple regression
   approach. Different policies and social norms in the two countries were
   reflected in reduced SUP use in Mexico compared to Spain and more
   recycling in Spain than in Mexico. The main reasons for the use of SUP
   were the lack of alternatives and forgetting reusable goods in the two
   countries. Feeling responsible for the ocean predicted the intention to
   use eco-friendly alternatives, while sea frequentation predicted
   recycling. Gender, age, and education influenced significantly the
   willingness to use eco-friendly alternatives. From the results of this
   study, campaigns promoting awareness through increased ocean literacy
   and marine citizenship-even in regions far from the sea-could promote
   reductions in SUP consumption, enhancing the use of sustainable
   alternatives. Those campaigns could be tailored by country, taking into
   account local policies and habits, gender, age, and educational levels.},

Abstract = {Food hawkers' knowledge about single-use plastic food containers must be
   assessed using a valid and reliable tool to improve assessment and
   evidence collection credibility and to promote environmental
   sustainability practice. This study aims to develop and validate a new
   questionnaire to assess the knowledge level of street food hawkers to
   support the single-use plastics reduction program. Seven experts were
   involved in the questionnaire process. In the validation process, a
   cross-sectional study employed the purposive sampling of 660
   night-market street food hawkers in a north-eastern state in Peninsular
   Malaysia, utilising a Google Forms questionnaire with 22
   self-administered items. The Content Validity Index (CVI) and Face
   Validity index (FVI) were used for the construct analysis. The
   dichotomous response scale was analysed using a two-parameter logistic
   model of item response theory (2-PL IRT), while marginal reliability
   used to determine the internal consistency. The I-CVI were calculated
   for all items with the value >= 0.83, except for nine items with I-CVI <
   0.83. I-FVI with values of 0.83 or more were acceptable. The 2-PL IRT
   analyses indicated good psychometric properties considering the
   discrimination and difficulty index. The marginal reliability value was
   0.77. The newly developed questionnaire is a valid and reliable tool to
   assess the knowledge level of street-food hawkers to support the
   single-use plastics reduction program.},

Abstract = {Efforts to understand macroplastic pollution have primarily focused on
   coastal and marine environments to the exclusion of freshwater,
   terrestrial, and urban ecosystems. To better understand macroplastics in
   the environment and their sources, a dual approach examining plastic
   input and leakage can be used. In this study, litter aggregation
   pathways at 40 survey sites with varying ambient population counts in
   the Ganges River Basin were surveyed in pre- and postmonsoon seasons. We
   examine active litter leakage using transect surveys of on-the-ground
   items, in conjunction with assessments of single-use plastic consumer
   products at the point of sale. We find that sites with low populations
   have a significantly higher number of littered items per 1,000 people
   than those with mid to high populations. Over 75\% of litter items were
   plastics or multimaterial items containing plastic, and tobacco products
   and plastic food wrappers were the most recorded items. There was no
   significant variation of litter densities pre- and postmonsoon. Most
   single-use plastic consumer products were manufactured in-country, but
   approximately 40\% of brands were owned by international companies.
   Stratified sampling of active litter input and consumer products
   provides a rapid, replicable snapshot of plastic use and leakage.},

Title = {Awareness about Ban on Single-use Plastic Items among Nursing
   Professionals: A Cross-sectional Survey},

Abstract = {Introduction: The government hospitals work round the clock and huge
   single-use non biodegradable plastic materials are used by patients,
   their attendants, staff and the public at large for their day-to-day
   activities. Therefore, awareness among the healthcare workers is
   essential for the full implementation of the policy of ban on single-use
   plastic items.
   Aim: To study the awareness regarding ban on single-use plastic items
   among Nursing Professionals.
   Materials and Methods: The present study was a crosssectional study done
   on nursing professionals across all seniority and from various specialty
   departments. Overall, 550 nursing professionals were included in the
   study. A pretested questionnaire, comprising 14 questions, was used as a
   study tool. Chi-square test was applied for studying the significant
   association among different variables.
   Results: The response rate was 91\% i.e., out of total 550 nursing
   professionals 498 participated in the study. It was observed that 37.4\%
   of participants were in the 31-40 years age group, 95\% were females,
   90.6\% were married and 90.4\% were from the urban area. It was found
   that the mean knowledge score of three knowledge questions (mean=1.120,
   SE=0.032, SD=0.715, 95\% CI=1.057-1.183) was higher among females,
   unmarried staff and respondents with a rural background. Primarily,
   majority of the nursing staff (i.e., 82\%) had learned about the ban on
   single-use plastic from television and newspaper rather than formal
   teaching/training.
   Conclusion: The hospitals should start regular formal teaching/training
   programme for increasing awareness of healthcare workers regarding ban
   of single-use plastic items. Thus, it is relevant to address this issue
   through well-planned formal training sessions.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastics (SUPs), invented for the modern ``throwaway
   society,{''} are intended to be used only once. They are being
   increasingly produced and used globally, most notably as packaging or
   consumables, such as SUP shopping bags or disposable tableware. We
   discuss how most SUPs are landfilled or incinerated, which causes
   pollution, consumes valuable land, and squanders limited natural
   resources. Only relatively small amounts are currently recycled, a
   hindrance to the concept of a circular economy. Moreover, SUP litter
   aggregation in the natural environment is a major concern. This article
   briefly reviews SUP contamination in various environmental media
   including soil, rivers, lakes and oceans around the world. In the face
   of mounting evidence regarding the threat posed to plant growth, soil
   invertebrates and other land animals, (sea) birds, and marine
   ecosystems, there is a growing push to minimize SUPs. Regulatory tools
   and voluntary actions to reduce SUP usage have been put forward, with
   some suggestions for minimizing SUP waste. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Sustainably Recycling and Upcycling of Single-Use Plastic Wastes through
   Heterogeneous Catalysis},
Journal = {CATALYSTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The huge amount of plastic waste has caused a series of environmental
   and economic problems. Depolymerization of these wastes and their
   conversion into desired chemicals have been regarded as a promising
   route for dealing with these issues, which strongly relies on catalysis
   for C-C and C-O bond cleavage and selective transformation. Here, we
   reviewed recent developments in catalysis systems for dealing with
   single-use plastics, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, and
   polyethylene glycol terephthalate. The recycling processes of
   depolymerization into original monomers and conversion into other
   economic-incentive chemicals were systemically discussed. Rational
   designs of catalysts for efficient conversion were particularly
   highlighted. Overall, improving the tolerance of catalysts to impurities
   in practical plastics, reducing the economic cost during the catalytic
   depolymerization process, and trying to obtain gaseous hydrogen from
   plastic wastes are suggested as the developing trends in this field.},

Abstract = {While plastics play an important role in the safety, shelf-life, and
   affordability of many foods, their mismanagement as waste presents a
   serious environmental problem. In 2019, governments in Canada and
   globally were poised to take legislative action to curb the use of
   single-use plastics, with strong public support. However, the COVID-19
   pandemic has since disrupted those initiatives as well as the public
   sentiment underlying them. The aim of our study is to measure changes in
   Canadian consumers' attitudes toward single-use plastic food packaging,
   from Summer 2019 to Summer 2020. The methodology relies on two,
   representative surveys of the Canadian population, carried out in May
   2019 (n = 1,094) and in June 2020 (n = 977). Our measures explored
   potential impacts on consumer perceptions, driven both by new food
   safety concerns during the pandemic and also by increased price
   consciousness during a time of economic recession. We found that 55\% of
   respondents were more concerned about food safety since COVID-19, and
   that 50\% of respondents had become more price conscious when buying
   groceries. However, we found only a slight decline in motivation to
   reduce plastics - though with a sharper reduction among males. A
   stronger shift was seen in attitudes towards policy, where our results
   show a clear decline in support for tighter regulations or bans on
   single-use plastics, along with an increase in consumers' willingness to
   pay for biodegradable alternatives. These findings suggest a more
   difficult road ahead for legislative approaches, but also potential
   opportunities for market-based strategies and innovations in the food
   sector.},

Abstract = {The excessive consumption of single-use plastic bags in recent years has
   fueled plastic pollution leading to considerable adverse consequences
   for human health and the environment. To control the high rates of
   plastic pollution and its marked effects in Pakistan's capital,
   Islamabad, the government imposed a ban on single-use plastic bags in
   August 2019. Hence, to overcome plastic pollution and successfully
   implement bans in other parts of the country, it is critical to study
   this ban's effectiveness and identify factors that contribute to its
   success. As research on this matter currently remains limited, present
   study attempts to understand the drivers for ban's support and evaluate
   the role that awareness, education and the availability of alternatives
   play in increasing support for this ban. The survey results exhibited a
   positive relationship between the aforementioned variables and support
   for the plastic bag ban. Although plastic bag consumption fell for
   77.5\% of the sample after the ban, it failed to be entirely effective
   in eradicating plastic bag usage as bags were widely available in small
   shops. Respondents felt that increasing awareness would reduce
   resistance against the ban, and the government, non-government
   organizations, and the general public should all take part in conducting
   these awareness campaigns.},

Abstract = {As non-biodegradable single-use plastic packaging products have been
   restricted in recent years, paper-based materials have attracted
   considerable attention owing to their environmental benefits. However,
   the hydrophilic nature of paper-based materials limits their application
   as replacements for non-biodegradable plastics. In this study, an
   environmentally friendly and multifunctional superhydrophobic paper was
   developed using silane-modified superhydrophobic nanofibrillated
   cellulose (M-NFC) via a simple spraying method. This paper can reduce
   the white pollution caused by non-degradable single-use plastic
   packaging products. Upon spraying the base paper with 1.5 g/m(2) of
   M-NFC, the coated paper (CP) exhibited excellent superhydrophobicity
   (water contact angle of 160 degrees), water repellency (Cobb value of
   7.5 g/m(2)), strong durability to sandpaper abrasion, finger-wipe,
   bending, folding, and sustained exposure to corrosion media (HCl with a
   pH of 1, NaOH with a pH of 10, high temperature treatment at 180 degrees
   C, and ultraviolet irradiation). Additionally, the CP surface directly
   prevented the adhesion of S. aureus and E. coli and also indirectly
   repelled solid contaminants upon washing with water, thereby
   demonstrating highly efficient antibacterial and anti-fouling
   properties. The durable and multifunctional superhydrophobic paper
   developed in this study provides a novel direction for solving white
   pollution and also presents a new research pathway for the potential
   applications of paper-based materials.

Title = {Life Cycle Assessment of Selected Single-Use Plastic Products towards
   Evidence-Based Policy Recommendations in Sri Lanka},

Abstract = {The global demand for plastic is expected to double in the next 20
   years. The increasing demand for Single-Use Plastic Products (SUPPs) has
   become one of the main environmental problems in many developing
   countries, including Sri Lanka, through direct and indirect means, in
   the way of excessive consumption and the pollution of the environment
   through waste generation. In this way, there is a pressing need to
   accelerate the sustainability evaluation, comparison, impact mitigation
   and policy recommendation of SUPPs to address the environmental impacts
   and sustainable development. Therefore, this study aims to quantify and
   compare the environmental impacts of SUPPs for policy decision making in
   Sri Lanka using life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques. Accordingly, the
   most popular and widely used single-use plastic products, which are
   under consideration for regulation in Sri Lanka, and their possible
   alternatives, are considered for this LCA study. The results reveal that
   SUPPs produced using polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), low-density
   polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and polyethylene
   terephthalate (PET) have a significant contribution in all life cycle
   stages, in terms of global warming potential (GWP) and endpoint impact
   categories. However, the outcomes of the study reveal that the net GWP
   impact of SUPPs that have recycling practice at the end of life shows
   better performance compared to incineration and landfill. In addition,
   the polylactic acid- (PLA)-based products also show a significant impact
   on mid- and end-point GWP impact categories. Remarkably, the midpoint
   analysis of PLA-based products and their alternatives emphasized that
   PLA production was the most impactful for most of the midpoint impact
   categories due to PLA resin production, which contributes significantly
   to all impact categories. In particular, for the pesticide bottles with
   the preferred end-of-life option of incineration, the HDPE indicates a
   7.6\% lower GWP compared to PET. For reusable steel cutlery, the largest
   GWP-associated life cycle stage is the user phase (97.5\%), which
   includes cleaning the cutlery. However, the overall reduction in GWP in
   the use of steel, considering the best (PS with recycling) and worst (PS
   with incineration) case scenarios, with single-use items are 0.01 and
   0.05 kg CO2 (eq), respectively. In the case of pesticide bottles, with
   the preferred end-of-life option being incineration, the HDPE indicates
   a 7.6\% lower GWP compared to PET. the study reveals that conducting LCA
   will facilitate scientific decision making for policy interventions
   related to SUPPs and their processes. Notably, the study shows that, at
   present, the capability of conducting LCA studies to evaluate the
   sustainability performance of SUPPs in Sri Lanka is limited due to the
   lack of life cycle inventory (LCI) data availability on SUPPs and
   relevant waste management practices in Sri Lanka.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastics (SUP), have been widely criticized for contributing
   to pollution and the throwaway culture. This paper applies the
   demarketing framework to SUP consumption in city tourism to spur
   tourists' anticipated reduction benefits of SUP. More specifically, this
   study quantifies the impact of the well-established demarketing mix
   components, adding people's motivations to avoid SUP. Data were
   collected through 326 self-administered questionnaires from city
   tourists in Ottawa, Canada, visiting areas surrounding the Canadian
   Parliament. A structural equation model was fitted for statistical data
   analysis covering the demarketing mix with three moderating variables -
   individual commitment, assigned responsibilities, and recycling
   attitude. The results suggest that modulating, respectively, promotion
   by showing the negative consequences of SUP; place, by reducing on-site
   availability of SUP; people's motivation, to reduce SUP usage; price, by
   imposing a price premium on SUP; and product, by substituting SUP for
   alternatives, will most strongly increase city tourists' anticipated
   reduction benefits.},

Abstract = {As environmental threats mount around the world, advocacy groups are
   exploring novel ways to reach the populace and spur them into action.
   The current study employs an experimental design with a control
   condition and a group that watched a pro-environmental video to test the
   risk information seeking and processing (RISP) model. A short
   environmental advocacy video demonstrated the ability to engage viewers
   in combatting the problem of single-use plastic overproduction by
   increasing risk perception, generating negative affect, encouraging
   information seeking, and fostering pro-environmental civic participation
   intentions. The present study contributes important theoretical insights
   to the RISP model and provides meaningful practical applications in the
   fight to protect our planet.},

Abstract = {This review analyzes the subject focus of 45 articles (published
   2019-2021), dealing with government action to regulate plastic
   pollution. Policies described in the articles and introduced between
   2016 and 2021 are clustered in four categories: production - consumption
   - disposal - circular approaches. Our results show that most published
   articles deal with bans on single-use plastic (SUP) items in one or more
   countries. While SUP bags are still the most regulated items, there is a
   growing number of regulations on other SUP items, such as Styrofoam
   products or microbeads. While policies and research focus heavily on the
   consumption phase, the production phase is not only under-regulated, but
   also under-researched.},

Abstract = {Plastic has been present in our lives for the past century as an
   essential material for many commodity items. However, the same
   properties that make plastic convenient are also responsible for the
   current dramatic environmental pollution. As an alternative, most of the
   world has been working with technological innovations, and one of its
   strategies is the use of bioplastics. Despite being considered
   environmentally beneficial by some people, there are still developments
   and discussions that need to be made. This article aims to present a
   legislative review and discusses the difficulty in implementing policies
   related to the incentive of the bioplastics market, as well as
   presenting some state and municipal laws, already prohibiting single-use
   plastics in Brazil. These laws aim to encourage the substitution of
   these plastics for biodegradable ones. However, it still has gaps and a
   lack of clarification on how the banning of disposable plastics and
   their substitution will be beneficial since composting is still an
   incipient process in the country. It is also the purpose of this article
   to discuss the challenges in the context of the Circular Economy, as
   well as the potential solution based on the creation of public policies
   aimed at improving waste management, in addition to clearer legislation
   on alternatives to single-use plastics.},

Abstract = {In the current post pandemic context, small and medium size enterprises,
   while recovering from covid-19 induced productivity dips, have been
   under pressure to make their operations and processes environmentally
   sustainable, guided by circular economic principles. Given that, drawing
   upon the institutional, resource-based view, upper echelon theory and
   norm activation theory, this study examines the influence of
   institutional pressures, resource availability, personal norms, and
   eco-innovation behaviour on SMEs' behavioural intention towards the
   reduction of single-use plastics. Data collected from 305 SMEs have been
   analyzed to draw inferences pertinent to making SMEs CE compliant. This
   study presents preliminary insights and understanding of the complex
   problem of reducing the usage of single use plastics from an integrated
   theoretical perspective, which will help policy makers in India and
   other emerging nations to take an informed view while formulating
   policies for SMEs in their respective countries.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastic waste have become ubiquitous in the natural
   environment globally. In Ghana, the drinking water sector has become
   heavily dependent on packaged water in the form of sachet and bottled
   water. This has resulted in increased generation of single-use plastic
   waste littered in the natural environment. Waste sachets, though still
   major a challenge, have received some attention over the years in terms
   of identifying solutions for sustainable management. On the other hand,
   limited studies have focused on waste plastic bottles in terms of their
   generation, disposal and options for sustainable management. This study
   sought to explore the socio-demographic and attitudinal drivers of
   bottled water consumption in Ayawaso West Municipal Area located in the
   Greater Accra Region of Ghana. The results showed that increasing income
   levels, perceptions of hygiene and safety as well as convenience were
   the main factors driving the patronage of bottled water. Bottled water
   consumption is expected to continue to rise in coming years in response
   to rising income levels. Residents showed willingness to engage in waste
   segregation of their plastics however limited waste collection systems
   are available to support this. It is important to prioritize the waste
   plastic bottles in the waste management agenda and offer households
   waste collection options that will make segregation of waste worthwhile
   and sustainable.},

Title = {Polymer composition assessment suggests prevalence of single-use

Abstract = {The ingestion of plastic is becoming a major concern for various species
   and particularly for marine turtles across the globe. The loggerhead sea
   turtle (Caretta caretta) was recently chosen by the European Commission
   as a bioindicator for plastic pollution within the Mediterranean basin.
   We further investigated which items this key species is more prone to
   ingest, following the standardised Marine Strategy Framework Directive
   protocols. Moreover, we integrated to this protocol the Fourier
   Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, which allowed us to determine the
   polymer type of each item. We analysed samples from 226 sea turtles from
   2008 to 2017 in two areas of the western Mediterranean sub-region (sensu
   MSFD). In the Lazio area we found a frequency of occurrence of plastic
   ingestion of 78.33\%, while in Sardinia 41.79\%. The analysis of the
   litter categories, among all individuals, highlights a prevalence of
   user-sheet (Use-She; 69.13\%) and user-fragment plastics (Use-Fra;
   20.84\%). In addition, the polymer analysis showed a dominance of
   polyethylene (65.98\%) and polypropylene (26.23\%). As a result, by
   looking at other works that have investigated polymer types and items
   sources, we are able to infer that 77.25\% of the objects ingested by
   the C. caretta individuals are attributable to disposable daily life
   objects managed in an improper way. Therefore, C. caretta apart from
   being an efficient bio-indicator for plastic pollution, highlighting
   spatial and temporal concentration differences, it could also be used to
   verify the effectiveness of the Single-use Plastic Directive (EU
   2019/904).},

Abstract = {Marine plastic pollution (MPP) is one of the major global environmental
   threats in the Anthropocene era that requires a coordinated legal
   response from local to international levels. This article explores how
   the Indonesian legal and institutional framework deals with MPP. Despite
   the diversity of existing instruments, Indonesia has not adopted all the
   necessary measures to prevent, reduce and control MPP from land and
   marine sources. Although progress at the national level to date has been
   relatively slow, some local authorities have recently taken the
   initiative to establish single-use plastics regulations, which offer
   promising prospects for MPP treatment in the future. Indonesia can only
   change its status as the second largest MPP contributor after China
   through a special law targeting plastic waste based on the life cycle of
   plastics and supported by consistent implementation.},

Title = {Prospect of microplastic pollution control under the ``New normal{''}
   concept beyond COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {367},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to increasing demand for
   single-use plastic which aggravates the already existing plastic waste
   problem. Not only does the demand for personal protective equipment
   (PPE) increase, but also people shift their preference to online
   shopping and food delivery to comply with administrative policies for
   COVID-19 pandemic control. The used PPEs, packaging materials, and food
   containers may not be handled or recycled properly after their disposal.
   As a result, the mismanaged plastic waste is discharged into the
   envi-ronment and it may pose even greater risks after breaking into
   smaller fragments, which was regarded as the source of secondary
   microplastics (MPs, < 5 mm) or nanoplastics (NPs, < 1 mu m). The main
   objective of this manuscript is to provide a review of the studies
   related to microplastic release due to pandemic-associated plastic
   waste. This study summarizes the limited work published on the
   ecotoxicological/toxicological effect of MPs/ NPs released from PPE on
   aquatic organisms, soil organisms, as well as humans. Given the current
   status of research on MPs from COVID-related plastic waste, the
   immediate research directions needed on this topic were discussed.},

Abstract = {Among the indirect environmental impacts generated by the global
   COVID-19 pandemic, contamination with personal protective equipment
   (PPE), like face masks, may be one of the most relevant ones. PPE has
   been found in multiple aquatic, marine, and terrestrial environments,
   including places of absolute relevancy to biodiversity conservation,
   such as protected areas (PM). Here, a brief report of the presence of
   PPE in six PM of Peru is presented. PPE pollution in PM consisted mainly
   of single-use and reusable face masks, as well as plastics associated
   with PM, such as KN95 respirator wrappings. The mean PPE density was
   estimated as 1.32 x 10(-3) PPE/m(2). FTIR spectroscopy confirmed that
   face masks and wrappers mainly consisted of polypropylene and
   polyethylene, two of the most commonly available synthetic polymers. The
   material was poorly degraded according to their FTIR spectra, possibly
   suggesting that they were discarded recently. The recent ban on
   single-use plastic in Peruvian PM is regarded as a great step forward
   toward the efforts made to preserve these invaluable places. However,
   these measures seemed insufficient to prevent PPE and other types of
   litter from contaminating areas of ecological importance. Considering
   the current scenario, several recommendations were proposed to be
   implemented in PM in order to prevent PPE from becoming a new plastic
   issue to tackle. These recommendations are expected to also serve for
   future events where the use of single-use plastics becomes inevitable,
   like global pandemics.},

Abstract = {In trying to address plastic bag pollution, governments around the world
   have recently adopted legislation that bans or discourages the use of
   single-use plastic bags. This study examines the variation in types of
   plastic bag legislation, and the extent to which geographic,
   socio-economic and political factors contribute to the adoption of
   single-use plastic bag legislation in the US. Using National Conference
   of State Legislatures, US Census, and plastic industry data, the study
   describes how plastic bag legislation varies among states, and
   identifies key factors that explain why states adopt plastic bag
   legislation. Findings indicate that plastic bag legislation varies by
   geography and political control of state legislatures. Additionally,
   results indicate that states in which local legislation has been adopted
   are more likely to adopt state-wide legislation. Finally, this study
   finds that shoreline mileage, green state index, and presence of state
   preemption laws to be strong predictors of plastic bag legislation
   adoption. Through its findings, the study informs policy makers about
   possible avenues that lead to the adoption of plastic bag legislation
   and discusses implications about implementation.},

Title = {Citizen science: A way forward in tackling the plastic pollution crisis

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {805},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented surge of
   production, consumption, and disposal of single-use plastics (SUPs) and
   personal protective equipment (PPE) by the public. This widespread use
   of mostly plastic items like face masks and disposable gloves has led to
   global reports of improper disposal of potentially infectious PPE both
   in our urban and natural environments. Due to international travel
   restrictions during the pandemic, many research programs targeted at
   measuring plastic pollution were halted. These disruptions to research
   programs have stunted the ability to assess the true quantities of SUPs
   and PPE being mismanaged from the waste stream into the environment.
   This article calls for increased citizen science participation in
   collecting plastic pollution data both during and post pandemic. By
   initiating this dialogue and raising attention to the importance and
   potential of citizen science data collection, data can be used to
   develop globally informed plastic pollution mitigation strategies . (c)

Title = {Curbing plastic consumption: A review of single-use plastic behaviour
   change interventions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {344},
Month = {APR 10},
Abstract = {Globally, millions of tonnes of plastic waste enter the environment each
   year. Various solutions have been offered to address the problems
   associated with plastic waste, such as circular business models and
   increased collection and processing. However, most solutions rely to
   some extent on changing individual-level behaviour. This study aimed to
   understand the types and effectiveness of behavioural interventions that
   have been implemented to reduce consumption of single-use plastics among
   individuals. A rapid review of literature, supplemented by a practice
   review, was undertaken in March 2021. Overall, interventions which
   relied on policy/regulatory tools were effective in the short term.
   However, poor evaluation and short-term monitoring were noted as
   short-comings. Similarly, voluntary behaviour change techniques were
   effective overall, but findings were mixed and modest. Importantly,
   while this review focused on individual-level behaviour change, findings
   highlighted that behaviour is often limited and enabled by other
   stakeholders, including businesses and governments. In conclusion,
   practitioners and policymakers designing future plastic reduction
   initiatives are advised to consider the bigger picture, engage with a
   variety of stakeholders, and utilise a combination of techniques which
   target multiple audiences within the system.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to estimate the generation of single-use
   plastics (SUPs) and elucidate consumer behavior towards a plastic-free
   university. The results show that the consumption rate of plastic
   bottles was the highest at 1.39 g per student per day (g.s(-1).d(-1)),
   followed by plastic cups (0.20 g s(-1).d(-1)),and plastic bags (0.14 g
   s(-1).d(-1)). Approximately 94.41\% of students were highly aware of the
   negative impacts of SUPs. More than four-fifths of the students
   (82.32\%) assumed that they were responsible for the SUP pollution
   issue, whereas 59.52\% considered SUP reduction (or lack thereof) by
   individuals, governments, and producers/businesses be important factors.
   Approximately 19.03\% of the students supported implementing a high
   fine, one-tenth agreed for a total ban on SUPs, while nearly one-fifth
   believed reducing SUP consumption was unnecessary. Strategies for
   plastic-free universities was initiated by establishing the goal of
   ``plastic-free university{''} and implementing integrated actions
   including a ban (plastic cups and bags) awareness-raising, and suitable
   alternatives.},

Abstract = {COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, was declared a global pandemic on 11
   March 2020 by the World Health Organization. The pandemic has triggered
   an unprecedented increase in the production, consumption and disposal of
   multiple types of plastic-based personal protective equipment (PPE) as a
   measure to reduce the infection. Recent research shows that plastic
   surfaces can serve as a fomite for coronavirus transmission as it can
   remain stable and be viable on polypropylene for up to 72 h or on other
   plastic surfaces for up to 9 days. While it is unknown whether or to
   what extent macroplastic debris and ubiquitous microplastics emitted
   into the environment can serve as physical vectors or fomites of
   pathogenic viruses, recent studies have reported that both macroplastic
   and microplastics can serve as vectors for harmful pathogens and
   invasive species (biological pollution). Here, hypothetical scenarios
   based on the weight of evidence are proposed to plausibly state the role
   of plastic debris (e.g., single-use-plastics), discarded PPE supplies,
   including facemasks, sanitizer bottles, gloves, and plastic bags, as
   well as microplastics as potential physical vectors of SARS-CoV-2,
   serving as a route of exposure to humans and wildlife in the
   terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Plastics have become an integral part of daily human life for the last
   50 years because, due to their durability, low cost and ease of
   construction, they have replaced many other materials. However, the same
   characteristics that make plastics particularly desirable are also what
   make them ubiquitous in the environment, especially as much of the
   plastic is designed to be discarded almost immediately after use. This
   study investigates the opinion and behavior concerning the current use
   of plastics, their end-of-life (recycling) scenario, and the potential
   for their replacement with more sustainable and biodegradable materials
   in Greece and Lebanon. The survey was conducted during April and May
   2021 in the main cities of the two countries. The data were collected
   using a structured questionnaire. The questionnaires were analyzed,
   using simple descriptive statistics, chi-square test and PCA analysis.
   The results show that even if the respondents of both countries stated
   significant awareness of environmental issues, they often use single-use
   plastics. Furthermore, the respondents (in both Greece and Lebanon) say
   that it would be fair to pay more for products in a package made of
   biodegradable materials. Finally, the statistical analysis of the
   results shows that in both Greece and Lebanon, there is a small increase
   in the use of reusable products during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to
   before the pandemic.},

Abstract = {Plastic pollution has reached a crisis point due to ineffective waste
   management, an over-reliance on single-use plastic items and a lack of
   suitable plastic alternatives. The COVID-19 Pandemic has seen a dramatic
   increase in the use of single-use plastics including `COVID waste' in
   the form of items specifically intended to help stop the spread of
   disease. Many governments have utilised COVID-19 as a window of
   opportunity to reverse, postpone or remove plastic policies off agendas
   ostensibly in order to `flatten the curve' of COVID-19 cases. In this
   paper, we use novel methods of social media analysis relating to three
   regions (USA, Mexico and Australia) to suggest that health and hygiene
   were not the only reasons governments utilised this window of
   opportunity to change plastic policies. Beyond the influence of social
   media on the plastics agenda, our results highlight the potential of
   social media as a tool to analyse public reactions to government
   decisions that can be influenced by industry pressure and a broader
   political agenda, while not necessarily following responses to consumer
   behaviour.},

Title = {Building Collective Ownership of Single-Use Plastic Waste in Youth
   Communities: A Jamaican Case Study},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution is a global environmental challenge with serious
   implications for human health. Most of the work on plastic waste to date
   has focused on assessing and mapping impacts and remedial activities,
   which are important but do not attempt to understand the attitude and
   behaviour of the consumer. The problem will only be resolved by changing
   behaviour to eliminate non-essential use of plastics and switch to less
   harmful alternatives, especially for Single-Use Plastic (SUP), which
   makes a disproportionate contribution to plastic waste. This study
   examines the attitudes and behaviour of teachers and parents/guardians
   in school communities as a step towards building collective ownership of
   SUP towards reducing the use of SUP. It establishes baseline data about
   attitudes and behaviour in four Jamaican primary schools. It examines
   the attitude of teachers and parents/guardians towards SUPs and uses
   cluster analysis to segment them based on attitude. The results identify
   the heterogeneous nature of groups within the same population and
   highlights the need for targeted interventions. This research can
   contribute towards the design of strategic interventions that will build
   a sense of collective ownership of the SUP problem and motivate
   effective changes in behaviour to minimise the use of SUPs in Jamaica.},

Title = {A New Green Composite Based on Plasticized Polylactic Acid Mixed with
   Date Palm Waste for Single-Use Plastics Applications},
Journal = {POLYMERS},

Abstract = {Petroleum-based plastic is widely used in almost all fields. However, it
   causes serious threats to the environment owing to its non-biodegradable
   properties, which necessitates finding biodegradable alternatives. Here,
   date palm rachis (DPR) waste was used as a filler (30, 40, and 50 wt\%)
   to form a biodegradable composite with polylactic acid (PLA) and achieve
   cost-performance balance. DPR-PLA composites were prepared using a
   melt-mixing extruder at 180 degrees C by varying mixing time, DPR
   composition, and plasticizer type and composition. The biodegradable
   testing specimens were prepared by compression molding and analyzed
   using physical, thermal, and mechanical characterizations. Scanning
   electron microscopy images indicated a uniform dispersion of DPR (90 mu
   m) in the PLA matrix. The esterification reaction resulting from this
   interaction between DPR and PLA was confirmed by Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy. The 30 wt\% DPR-PLA composite was considered the
   optimal composite with the lowest melt flow index (16 g/10 min). This
   work confirmed the superior effect of addition of 10 wt\% of triethyl
   citrate (TEC) compared with polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) by
   the improvement in the elongation at break of the optimal composite from
   2.10\% to 4.20\%. Moreover, the addition of 10 wt\% of PBAT to the
   optimal composite resulted in a lower tensile strength (21.80 MPa) than
   that of the composite with 10 wt\% of TEC (33.20 MPa). These results
   show the potential of using the proposed composite as an alternative
   material for single-use plastics such as cutlery.},

Title = {SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-induced PPE and single-use plastic waste generation

Abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has demonstrated both positive and negative
   effects on the environment. Major concerns over personal hygiene,
   mandated and ease in lockdown actions and slackening of some policy
   measures have led to a massive surge in the use of disposable personal
   protective equipment (PPE) and other single-use plastic items. This
   generated an enormous amount of plastic waste from both healthcare and
   household units, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
   Apart from the healthcare workers, the general public have become
   accustomed to using PPE. These habits are threatening the land and
   marine environment with immense loads of plastic waste, due to improper
   disposal practices across the world, especially in developing nations.
   Contaminated PPE has already made its way to the oceans which will
   inevitably produce plastic particles alongside other pathogen-driven
   diseases. This study provided an estimation-based approach in
   quantifying the amount of contaminated plastic waste that can be
   expected daily from the massive usage of PPE (e.g. facemasks) because of
   the countrywide mandated regulations on PPE usage. The situation of
   Bangladesh has been analysed and projections revealed that a total of
   3.4 billion pieces of single-use facemask, hand sanitizer bottles, hand
   gloves and disposable polyethylene bags will be produced monthly, which
   will give rise to 472.30 t of disposable plastic waste per day. The
   equations provided for the quantification of waste from used single-use
   plastic and PPE can be used for other countries for rough estimations.
   Then, the discussed recommendations will help concerned authorities and
   policy makers to design effective response plans. Sustainable plastic
   waste management for the current and post-pandemic period can be
   imagined and acted upon.},

Abstract = {Plastics have become a severe transboundary threat to natural ecosystems
   and human health, with studies predicting a twofold increase in the
   number of plastic debris (including micro and nano-sized plastics) by
   2030. However, such predictions will likely be aggravated by the
   excessive use and consumption of single-use plastics (including personal
   protective equipment such as masks and gloves) due to COVID-19 pandemic.
   This review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview on the effects of
   COVID-19 on macroplastic pollution and its potential implications on the
   environment and human health considering shortand long-term scenarios;
   addressing the main challenges and discussing potential strategies to
   overcome them. It emphasises that future measures, involved in an
   emergent health crisis or not, should reflect a balance between public
   health and environmental safety as they are both undoubtedly connected.
   Although the use and consumption of plastics significantly improved our
   quality of life, it is crucial to shift towards sustainable
   alternatives, such as bio-based plastics. Plastics should remain in the
   top of the political agenda in Europe and across the world, not only to
   minimise plastic leakage and pollution, but to promote sustainable
   growth and to stimulate both green and blueeconomies. Discussions on
   this topic, particularly considering the excessive use of plastic,
   should start soon with the involvement of the scientific community,
   plastic producers and politicians in order to be prepared for the near
   future.},

Title = {Contradictory or complementary? Stakeholders' perceptions of a circular
   economy for single-use plastics},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {142},
Pages = {1-8},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Single-use plastics (SUPs) represent one of the largest and rapidly
   growing segments of the plastics industry. The strategies to mitigate
   plastic hazards has become more difficult during the COVID-19 pandemic;
   SUPs have gained positive health-related attributes among consumers and
   remain the preferred packaging material. One of the most promising
   strategies to tackle the SUPs problem is a worldwide transition towards
   a circular economy (CE) for plastics. Here, we propose the
   reconceptualization of a CE for SUPs based on an analysis of the
   perceptions of stakeholders and the public from social, psychological,
   and communication-related perspectives. Our study utilized focus groups
   with primary and secondary stakeholders - differing in their power
   regarding SUP CE governance - and general consumers to identify their
   perceptions regarding challenges to and solutions for a CE for SUPs,
   thereby unveiling the potential for trustworthy knowledge co-creation.
   Our findings demonstrate that trustworthy knowledge-in-action is the
   primary driver for achieving sustainability transitions across
   stakeholders and suggest a significant discrepancy between young
   consumers and producers. Furthermore, we argue that exploring
   diversified approaches to knowledge co-creation necessitates various
   disciplinary entry points, ranging from different perspectives
   (challenges vs. solutions, individual vs. systemic levels, diversity in
   agenda-setting) to innovative attempts to understand knowledge
   production behaviour, especially for policymakers. Perceiving scientists
   as science communicators who can effectively inform involved
   stakeholders and general consumers and engage them in SUP crisis
   mitigation actions, the results of our study (jointly created manifest
   followed by a series of posters) are subject to further research and
   proposals for policy decisions.},

Title = {Assessment of Community's Perception Toward Single-Use Plastic Shopping
   Bags and Use of Alternative Bags in Jimma Town, Ethiopia},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INSIGHTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of plastic shopping bags increases and poses
   tremendous pressure on the local environment. However, little is known
   about its utilization among different population categories and their
   perception of its utilization and willingness to use other sustainable
   alternatives. This study aimed to assess the community's perception
   toward the use of plastic shopping bags and its options in Jimma town.
   Ethiopia
   METHODS: A community-based descriptive cross-sectional study design was
   conducted on 351 customers and retailers selected from the town's main
   marketing areas. The data was collected using a structured questionnaire
   in a face-to-face interview and analyzed using SPSS v.21.
   RESULTS: The results show that all the respondents use plastic shopping
   bags for different shopping services. The majority (147 (41.9\%)) of the
   respondents said that they use 5 to 10 shopping bags. and 66 (18.8\%)
   use more than 10 shopping bags per week. Participants responded with
   different reasons for the frequent use of plastic bags for shopping.
   Accordingly. 116 (33.0\%) responded that plastic bags are cheap. 92
   (26.2\%) use them due to lack of alternatives, and 89 (25.4\%) responded
   that plastic bags are light and convenient to use. However. 326 (93\%)
   of the respondents support efforts to reduce single-use plastic bags.
   284 (80.9\%) support a ban on single-use plastic bags. and 319 (90\%)
   were willing to pay for alternative shopping bags.
   CONCLUSION: Communities are aware of the environmental problems
   associated with the intensive use of plastic shopping bags, their
   wastes, and the need for alternative options. However, it will continue
   to pose significant environmental challenges unless low-cost and
   environment-friendly alternative options are available.},

Abstract = {As one of the flagship amendments to the Plastic Waste Management (PWM)
   Rules, 2021, the pan-Indian ban on a group of single-use plastic
   products (SUPPs) introduced in mid-2022 provided a departure point
   towards more progressive plastic waste legislation. The amendments have
   mostly been welcomed, yet challenges persist to facilitate its
   implementation, assess potential environmental impacts of alternative
   materials, and socioeconomic concerns raised by various stakeholders.
   Considering the recent amendments to the PWM Rules, we critically engage
   with and highlight key considerations and prevailing challenges with
   regards to phasing out SUPPs. We argue that to shape sustainable
   solutions that reduce plastic pollution, uncertainties related to the
   environmental fate of SUPP alternatives need to be better understood,
   whilst recognising and accounting for broader socio-economic impacts of
   SUPP bans, including industry concerns, impacts on socio-economically
   disadvantaged communities, and the informal recycling sector. A stronger
   knowledge base on these aspects can mitigate negative social and
   environmental externalities, including potentially harmful consequences
   of ambitious plastic pollution reduction measures.},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper employed the self-determination theory (SDT) to
   examine the synergistic impacts of intrinsic, extrinsic and prosocial
   motivations in promoting sustained pro-environmental consumption
   behaviors (PECB). To provide evidence for the study's theoretical
   framework, the authors focus on the behavior of reducing single-use
   plastics. Design/methodology/approach A mall-intercept survey for
   consumption of single-use plastic products in three big cities of
   Vietnam (Hanoi, Da Nang and Ho Chi Minh city) was conducted to test the
   theoretical framework. In total, 468 consumers completed the
   questionnaires. Data were analyzed with SPSS and AMOS. Findings
   Intrinsic and prosocial motivations are found to be significant
   predictors of sustained PECB. More importantly, beyond the direct
   effects of intrinsic and prosocial motivations, the authors also found
   positive interaction effects between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation
   and between intrinsic and prosocial motivation on encouraging sustained
   PECB. Originality/value This research offers a new insight for
   encouraging sustained PECB. Different from the extant perspectives which
   usually deal with initiating PECB, the authors emphasize sustaining the
   behavior. Moreover, this research examines the interaction effects
   between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations and between intrinsic and
   prosocial motivations in sustaining PECB.},

Abstract = {The introduction of reusable packaging systems (both refill and return)
   has the potential to significantly reduce waste from single-use plastic
   packaging. However, for these schemes to be successful, both the
   environmental impact and the willingness of consumers to engage with
   such systems need to be carefully considered. This paper combines and
   discusses two complementary studies: (i) a life cycle assessment
   comparing the environmental impacts of single-use, refillable, and
   returnable containers for a takeaway meal, and (ii) a large online
   survey of UK adults exploring what types of product and packaging
   consumers are willing to reuse, how, and why. The findings of the life
   cycle assessment indicate that reusable containers outperform single-use
   plastic containers on most measures of environmental impact. The survey
   found that given the choice of disposal, reuse or recycling, that
   recycling is the preferred method of dealing with packaging once empty
   in the UK, and that people's decisions with regards to what types of
   packaging they are willing to reuse are largely driven by the aspects of
   the packaging itself (e.g., material and type) rather than the nature of
   the product inside of the packaging (e.g., state of matter of the
   contents). The survey also showed that people were more willing to
   engage in reuse systems with which they were already familiar.
   Additionally the language used to describe these schemes and the term
   `reuse' needs to be considered. Combined, these factors can be used to
   determine the best packaging reuse system for a given product and
   situation. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {A regional understanding of beach litter abundance, distribution, and
   composition is fundamental to formulate strategies to manage litter
   pollution in a particular area. The present study aimed to quantify and
   characterize the macro (2.5 cm to 1m), meso (5 mm-2.5 cm), and micro
   litter (<= 5 mm) in the intertidal and backshore area of six sandy
   beaches utilized for various activities along the southeast coast of
   India. Macro litter was collected within 100m transects, while meso and
   micro litter was collected within 1 m2 quadrats (n = 5) from each
   beach's intertidal and backshore regions. In this study, the average
   beach litter concentrations were 0.24 +/- 0.14 items/ m2 (macro), 8.2
   +/- 5.6 items/m2 (meso), and micro litter was 505 +/- 121 particles/kg
   of dry sediment. The backshore had a higher litter concentration than
   the intertidal area. Beaches closer to urban centers and multiple
   activities had higher litter abundance than more remote beaches. Using
   the Clean Coast Index (CCI), four beaches i.e., Neelankarai, Kovalam,
   Auroville, and Paradise are characterized as moderately clean beaches,
   whereas, the other two beaches i.e., Nemmeli and Palar are clean and
   very clean, respectively. Even though the beaches were found to be
   moderately clean, there is an urgent need to improve local waste
   management of beach litter. We suggest regular cleaning of river banks,
   a strict ban of single-use plastic in the beach area, and raising
   awareness e.g., by involving school and college students adopting a
   local beach.},

Title = {Consumer Preference for Attributes of Single-Use and Multi-Use Plastic
   Shopping Bags in Cape Town: A Choice Experiment Approach},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Single-use plastic bags are increasingly becoming unpopular across the
   globe due to growing concerns over plastic pollution, which is
   threatening both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Creating policy
   interventions to reduce plastic consumption requires objective
   information about local conditions. This study uses a choice experiment
   to elicit consumer preference for attributes of shopping bags from a
   sample of 250 consumers in Cape Town. Following the literature, we
   estimate the conditional logit model and the mix logit model and perform
   appropriate tests to establish a model which fits our data. Our results
   show that consumers in Cape Town prefer small and medium-sized bags
   relative to the status quo. They also care about durability,
   reusability, style, and recyclability of shopping bags. The highest
   willingness to pay is associated with a medium-sized shopping bag
   (R3.76), followed by a shopping bag that is reusable (R3.35), then a
   shopping bag that is styled (R2.16), then a small-sized shopping bag
   (R1.74), then a durable shopping bag (R1.50) and finally a recyclable
   shopping bag (R1.25). By aggregation, the willingness to pay of a
   small-sized shopping bag that is recyclable is R2.99 which is equivalent
   to the maximum price that the respondent is offering for a single-use
   plastic bag (R2.92). The willingness to pay of a medium-sized and
   reusable shopping bag is R7.11 per unit which is at least as high as the
   minimum price that respondents would consider for alternative packaging
   (R7.37). Finally, taking into consideration all the important
   attributes, we arrive at a willingness to pay ranging from R9.99 to
   R12.01 per bag for a small and medium shopping bag, respectively. Our
   results call for a combination of policy instruments such as a subsidy
   on expensive durable and reusable shopping bags to increase demand while
   at the same time increasing the levy on single-use plastic bags to
   reduce demand. More effort is needed to increase appreciation and
   perception of recyclable products.},

Title = {Identifying barriers to reducing single-use plastic use in a coastal
   metropolitan city in Canada},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {210},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Nearly half of all plastic produced is discarded after a single use.
   Single-use plastics (SUPs) are persistent in the environment and
   commonly found during shoreline and coastal cleanups. The food service
   industry is a major source of SUPs used by consumers. Business
   recognition programs can help reduce SUP use in the food service
   industry but have only been implemented in small coastal communities in
   Nova Scotia (e.g., Ocean Friendly Nova Scotia {[}OFNS]). Due to its
   coastal proximity, Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) was chosen for
   this case study. HRM is the largest coastal metropolitan city in Nova
   Scotia and has potential for SUP leakage into the marine environment,
   but currently has no business recognition program to reduce SUP use.
   Using quantitative and qualitative methods, this study identified the
   main barriers to reducing SUP use in HRM. Two online surveys gauged
   interest in reducing SUP use among community members and food-based
   businesses in HRM. Follow up interviews with interested businesses aimed
   to understand concerns and challenges faced by business owners to reduce
   SUP use, and subsequent potential leakage into the marine environment.
   Results indicate overwhelming public interest in SUP reduction, as well
   as concerns among businesses about sourcing sustainable alternatives.
   Recommendations include increasing accessibility of sustainable
   alternatives, a guide for best practices, and public education. These
   recommendations may serve as a roadmap for SUP reduction strategies
   across different jurisdictions.},

Abstract = {Over the years, the world was not paying strict attention to the impact
   of rapid growth in plastic use. This has led to unprecedented amounts of
   mixed types of plastic waste entering the environment unmanaged.
   Packaging plastics account for half of the global total plastic waste.
   This paper seeks to give an overview of the use, disposal, and
   regulation of food packaging plastics. Demand for food packaging is on
   the rise as a result of increasing global demand for food due to
   population growth. Most of the food packaging are used on-the-go and are
   single use plastics that are disposed of within a short space of time.
   The bulk of this plastic waste has found its way into the environment
   contaminating land, water and the food chain. The food industry is
   encouraged to reduce, reuse and recycle packaging materials. A wholistic
   approach to waste management will need to involve all stakeholders
   working to achieve a circular economy. A robust approach to prevent
   pollution today rather than handling the waste in the future should be
   adopted especially in Africa where there is high population growth.},

Abstract = {Recognizing modern society's multiple risks, this study examines
   single-use plastic water bottles at the intersection of environmental
   degradation and societal carelessness for the elderly. While
   prioritising economic profits and plastic waste, we have neglected
   bottles' typical poor openability for older people. Thus, we evaluated
   the openability of bottles with environmentally friendly and socially
   inclusive designs in South Korea by comparing older and younger adults'
   experiences. Integrating different attributes than existing studies that
   analyse opening torque or one-handed opening, the test results show that
   older adults experience the poorest two-handed openability when bottles
   have both a weight thickness lower than 14.42 g and an easily squeezable
   bottle structure. In South Korea, companies advocate eco-friendliness by
   valuing lighter weight with less plastic and support user-friendliness
   by adopting easily squeezed sidewall patterns, while the industry
   maintains broad opening torque regulations; however, we show this
   combination exceeds older users' capabilities. That is, for openability,
   bottles need to keep a weight thickness greater than 12 g, abandon
   easily squeezed sidewall patterns or reduce the opening torque
   regulation range to 100 N-cm. These socially favourable but ecologically
   adverse measures will be sustainable when the efficient linear economy
   transitions to an effective circular economy.},

Title = {Single-Use Plastic Bans: Exploring Stakeholder Perspectives on Best
   Practices for Reducing Plastic Pollution},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTS},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this study, we conducted and documented workshops and interviews in
   Norway and Slovenia to identify stakeholder and future generation
   opinions and mitigation strategies for solving one of the most prominent
   environmental issues: plastic pollution. As part of the EU H2020 project
   GoJelly, stakeholders were brought together to explore their perceptions
   on considering jellyfish mucus as a new resource to contribute to
   reducing plastic pollution from entering the marine environment. The
   study was conducted in the spring of 2019, in a context directly after
   the European Union (EU) announced its Directive to ban the most commonly
   used single-use plastic (SUP) items. The study applied the snowball
   method as a methodological choice to identify relevant stakeholders.
   Systems thinking was utilized as a participatory modelling approach,
   which allowed for the creation of conceptual mind maps from the various
   workshops and interviews, to understand consumers' consciousness, and to
   map out ideas on plastic pollution reduction. Plastic pollution takes
   place on a global scale and stakeholders discussed their individual
   perceptions of national and international solutions that could be put in
   place to solve it, including the opportunities around utilizing
   jellyfish mucus to filter and capture micro- and nanoplastic. We found
   that industry stakeholders in both case areas were generally more
   accepting of policy and increased innovation moving forward, but placed
   weight on the scientific community to conduct more research on the
   pollution issue and propose solutions. Future generation stakeholders
   (youth aged 14-18), however, put emphasis on consumer behavior and
   buying patterns of single-use products fueling the plastic crisis.},

Abstract = {Consumer single-use plastic waste has received much attention from the
   public, policy-makers and researchers. However, the management of such
   waste in medical settings has been less well examined. This article
   reviews existing evidence on waste management strategies within
   hospitals, with a particular focus on single-use plastics. The article
   develops the `Waste Hierarchy-Technology Readiness Levels' framework and
   assesses each waste management strategy against it, indicating the
   maturity of the technology and the strategy's position in the Waste
   Hierarchy, in addition to its relative adherence to circular economy
   principles. Findings show that currently dominant waste management
   strategies include disposal to landfill, incineration and recycling,
   while alternative strategies include reduction, reuse, bioremediation
   and chemical recycling. Most strategies reviewed are at a high level of
   technology readiness and at a low level on the Waste Hierarchy,
   demonstrating that hospital waste management strategies tend to be based
   on mature technologies and suggesting a need for more innovative,
   circular economy solutions. Exceptions, which are at a high level on the
   Waste Hierarchy but at an early stage of development, include
   bioremediation using microbial action and chemical recycling using
   hydrophilic solvents. This review highlights a disparity between the
   levels of alignment with the circular economy principles in waste
   management strategies of developed and developing nations, suggesting a
   need for both international collaboration and strategies sensitive to
   specific regional contexts. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Over a million plastic bottles are bought around the world every minute,
   20,0 0 0 every second. While there is agreement that single-use plastics
   should be phased out, records of plastic pollution point in the opposite
   direction. Until the phasing-out of single-use plastics materialises,
   there is an immediate opportunity to mitigate the environmental impacts
   of plastic use through better design, that is to improve material
   efficiency without affecting function or performance. In this article,
   we focus on a standard plastic milk bottle, which we redesign based on a
   previously developed shape factor for the sustainability of forms,
   achieving a -13\% material reduction. Environmental benefits are
   evaluated globally through hybrid life-cycle assessment (LCA) both in
   the 10 countries in which the original plastic bottle is used and the
   other 22 countries upstream in the supply chain. Results obtained
   through hybrid LCA are 17.3\% higher than those obtained through
   process-based LCA. Environmental benefits arising in the 22 countries in
   the upstream supply chain are twice as much as those observed in the 10
   countries where the original bottle is used. Overall, our findings show
   a potential annual reduction of -1.9 Mt CO 2 e, equivalent to
   approximately 415,0 0 0 cars taken off the road, thus proving the
   substantial and viable benefits that can be achieved by material
   efficiency through redesign. (c) 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Abstract = {Due to intensive utilization and extensive production, plastic waste is
   becoming a serious threat to the environment and human health. The
   situation is even worse in countries such as the United Arab Emirates
   (UAE), where single-use plastic water bottles add to the load of plastic
   pollution. The main objective of this survey was to assess the extent of
   bottled water utilization by the UAE residents and their awareness of
   the environmental concerns arising from single-use plastic bottles. The
   aim was also to evaluate their willingness to shift towards using
   biodegradable plastic bottles. This study involved the feedback of 2589
   respondents living in the UAE. The eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) was
   applied to determine the most responsible variables explaining the
   variability of our data set. A chi-square analysis was also used to
   determine the significance among the responses. Most of the respondents
   to this survey were UAE nationals (79.8\%) of ages ranging from 21 to 35
   years (42\%), who were educated, with most holding a university degree
   (69.6\%). Regardless of their gender, age, occupation, education, and
   income, a large group of respondents (40.7\%) was concerned about the
   impact of their purchased items on the environment; however, the
   frequency of plastic products recycled was observed to be low (49.7\%).
   According to the findings of this survey, 42.4\% of the respondents were
   likely to purchase 100\% biodegradable bottles, and about 70\% of the
   respondents expressed a willingness to spend at least AED 1 more for
   purchasing 100\% biodegradable bottles.},

Abstract = {ABSTR A C T This study explores the tenacity of the plastics market and
   reveals blame work to explain market status quo. Anti-plastic advocates
   accuse corporations and regulators of inefficient measures deployed to
   control the omnipres-ence, hazardous effects, and indestructability of
   plastic. Regulators focus on single-use plastic and recycling to
   mitigate the omnipresence of plastic and delegate responsibility to
   other actors for its hazardous effects and indestructability. Plastic
   producers and distributors avoid blame by developing alternatives to
   single-use plastic. Consumers locally and sporadically blame policy
   makers and corporations for plastic problems but lack resources and
   social organization to effect broad changes in the market. From all
   these dynamics of blame emerges a scapegoat: consumers accepting
   responsibility for plastic problems. Dynamics of blame help maintain
   boundaries of power and interest and contribute to consumer
   responsibilization, reinforce power imbalances, hinder collaboration
   among actors with different interests in plastic, and, as such, help
   maintain market status quo.},

Abstract = {Environmental awareness of the effects of single-use plastic packaging
   and the shortage of non-renewable resources have encouraged the search
   for alternative materials. Most of single-use plastic packaging is in
   the food sector, including bags, straws, bottle lids, coffee stirrers,
   soda and water bottles. Biopolymers and biocomposites have a high
   potential to be eco-friendly, economic and technically competitive with
   fossil-based plastics and conventional composites. This paper presents a
   case study of life-cycle analysis supporting the design and development
   of a bottle lid as food packaging by applying a life-cycle engineering
   methodology to select a biocomposite material. Two current materials
   with high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polylactic acid (PLA) and 10
   alternative biocomposite materials of hybrid matrix (mixtures of HDPE
   and PLA) and contents of banana fibre (BF) were evaluated. The analysis
   is performed by integrating of life cycle assessment, life cycle cost
   and technical analysis. The results show that the material with higher
   BF content is the best alternative both technically and environmentally,
   while the material with lower BF content is the best alternative
   economically. Therefore, the importance attributed to each dimension of
   analysis is pondered and traded-off to allow an aggregated analysis of
   the alternatives and a well-informed decision-making.},

Title = {Drivers of public plastic (mis)use - New insights from changes in
   single-use plastic usage during the Covid-19 pandemic},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {849},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {The coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) has influenced resource use and how
   people interact with their environment, with changing priorities and
   competing public health factors affecting pro-environmental behaviours
   at individual, so-cietal, business and political levels.We used data
   from an online plastic footprint calculator to explore temporal changes,
   purchasing patterns and con-sumer behaviours around on-the-go plastic
   use during the pandemic. We hypothesised that 1) people's plastic use
   when on-the-go would change in response to the pandemic and related
   government restrictions and; 2) single-use plas-tic use on-the-go would
   decrease during lockdown periods due to restrictions against leaving
   home. The calculator received 1937 responses, with 13,544 plastic items
   recorded. Most used were food wrappers (54 \% of all items), takeaway
   containers (12 \%) and bottles (9 \%). Six out of seven items showed
   increased use during lockdowns, in-line with our first hypothesis, but
   not the second. Three times more bottles were used, food wrapper
   consumption almost doubled, and takeaway container use more than
   doubled. Increased container use occurred alongside increased takeaway
   meal consumption during lockdowns. Patterns were similar between
   different periods of lockdown, with no significant differences in the
   number used of any items, or percentage of respondents using them.
   Results indicate that during lockdown, people found it harder to avoid
   single-use plastic while on-the-go, supporting evidence from other
   studies that plastic use can be driven by perceptions of hygiene
   benefits and lack of ``safe{''} alternatives. Our results in-dicate
   opportunities to reduce single-use plastic consumption and we provide
   examples of successful implementation. Our findings evidence that, when
   properly applied, government-led guidance can effectively support
   consumer choices for reduced plastic use, encourage use of reusables,
   increase provision of alternatives, and dispel hygiene myths. The sudden
   increase in plastic waste due to the Covid-19 pandemic amplifies the
   need to substantiate plastic reduction policy promises without further
   delay.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The mismanagement of plastic materials has grown to become a mounting
   global pollution concern that is closely implicated in unsustainable
   production and consumption paradigms. The ecological, social, and
   economic impacts of plastic waste mismanagement are currently
   transboundary in nature and have necessitated numerous methods of
   government intervention in order to address and mitigate the globalized
   and multifaceted dilemmas posed by high rates and volumes of plastic
   waste generation. This review examines the current landscape of a
   plastics economy which has operated with a linear momentum, employing
   large quantities of primary resources and disincentivizing the
   functioning of a robust recycling market for collecting plastic waste
   and reintegrating it into the consumer market. This contextualizes an
   increasing plastic pollution crisis that has required global efforts to
   address and mitigate the ecological risks and socio-economic challenges
   of mismanaged plastic waste. A timeline of government interventions
   regarding plastic pollution is described, including numerous
   international, regional, and local actions to combat plastic waste, and
   this is followed by an examination of the relevance of the extended
   producer responsibility principle to improve plastic waste management
   and obligate industry to assume responsibility in waste collection and
   recycling.},

   plastic shopping bags and various alternatives available in South Africa},

Abstract = {Purpose The pervasive use of plastics, coupled with inadequate waste
   management systems in many countries, has led to widespread leakage of
   plastics into the environment. In South Africa, the predominant type of
   shopping bags are single-use plastic bags; but paper, biodegradable
   plastic and re-usable bags have emerged as alternatives. To compare
   these alternatives in terms of environmental impacts across the whole
   product life cycle, we carried out a cradle-to-grave life cycle
   assessment (LCA) of 16 shopping bag types available in South Africa.
   Methods The comparison includes single-use plastic, bioplastic and paper
   bags, as well as re-usable bags (typically made from plastic in South
   Africa). The functional unit was based on the estimated annual volume of
   groceries purchased per capita. An attributional LCA was carried out
   using the ReCiPe 2016 Midpoint(H) method, with 18 mid-point impact
   categories. In addition, given the lack of an impact category for
   plastic pollution in existing methods, we developed a mid-point
   indicator based on the persistence of plastics (and other materials)
   leaked to the environment (Persistence of leaked material,
   Persistence(LM)). Specific attention was placed on modelling end-of-life
   and waste management in the South African context. Economic-based
   allocation at the point of substitution was used to apportion
   environmental impacts to virgin and recyclate material, and the
   production of recyclate was modelled using system expansion. Results and
   discussion Re-usable bag types, specifically the 70 mu m High Density
   Polyethylene (HDPE) and non-woven Polyester bags, had the lowest
   environmental impacts for all indicators, except Persistence(LM). Paper
   and biodegradable plastic bags had a lower Persistence(LM) impact as
   compared to the petro-based plastic bags, and therefore may be
   preferable in terms of avoiding plastics accumulating in the
   environment. The re-usable bags need to be used at least 3 to 10 times
   to offer lower environmental impacts than single-use ones. Among the
   single-use bags, biodegradable bags made from imported Polybutylene
   Adipate Terepthalate (PBAT) plus starch showed the lowest environmental
   impacts across all impact categories, including Persistence(LM),
   followed by the Paper bag. The single-use 24 mu m HDPE bag (HDPE\_24)
   with no recycled content had the highest overall environmental impacts,
   while increasing the recycled content reduced overall environmental
   impacts by up to 52\%. Compared to other countries, the high
   environmental impacts of plastic bags in South Africa can largely be
   attributed to the coal-to-liquids process used for polymer production,
   which is intensive in terms of both energy and raw materials.},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate factors influencing customer behavior
   towards nylon bags and single-use plastics. These factors are
   environmental protection awareness, health protection awareness, sense
   of responsibility, expectations, and green marketing. A quantitative
   method with the use of surveys is deployed to collect data of young
   people under 30, generating 1650 valid responses. The collected data is
   then analyzed with SPSS 22, using Cronbach's Alpha and Exploratory
   Factor Analysis to test the reliability of the model before validating
   the hypotheses by regression analysis. The study found that the majority
   of respondents are inclined to use plastic bags, despite their
   environmental awareness. The results also demonstrate that health
   consciousness, environmental concerns, self-driven responsibility for
   the sustainability of young people have a significant impact on their
   behaviors in using nylon bags and plastic products, whereas expectation
   and green marketing are confirmed not to be the factors. The study
   suggests that if green marketing is to gain higher influence, an
   increase in research and development to support other environmentally
   friendly packaging would be the right path. Finally, this research
   proposes some feasible recommendations for the government, which include
   imposing bolder and more targeted environmental policies on consumers
   and introducing educational campaigns to raise awareness about
   minimizing plastic consumption.},

Abstract = {Aim: The work undertaken in this paper intends to reduce the negative
   environmental effects of single-use plastics especially to trim down the
   medical waste generated post-utilization of plastic intravenous tubes.
   The present study emphasizes on the production, characterization of
   banana peel starch-based bioplastic with Glycerin as bioplastic adhesive
   or plasticizer.Problem statement: Single-use plastic medical wastes
   derived from petroleum-based sources continue to accu-mulate in
   landfills and leach into the environment. Managing plastics and medical
   wastes tends to be an urgent environmental crisis and poses a serious
   threat to the same, and switching to biodegradable plastics can help to
   alleviate the problem.Methodology: Three assorted banana peel
   starch-based bioplastic samples were fabricated using assorted mixtures
   of Banana peel starch, Corn starch, Vinegar, Glycerin and distilled
   water. All the three samples were subjected to evaluation tests such as
   moisture content, water absorption, water solubility, alcohol
   solubility, Soil degradation, tensile strength study and FTIR analysis.
   In addition, the intravenous tube was simulated using ANSYS software,
   and its flow and velocity profiles were studied and tested.Conclusion:
   Obtained results evince that banana peel starch-based bioplastic
   sample-II has the necessary physi-ochemical and mechanical properties,
   which may be printed and molded as intravenous tube in future, for
   infusion and transfusion applications.},

   Case Study of Atlantic Canada},

Abstract = {Government-led legislation is a key strategy to reduce plastic
   pollution; however, societal perception can heavily influence government
   intervention for environmental issues. To understand the public
   acceptability of government action to reduce plastic pollution, we
   examine the perception of existing and upcoming legislative action on
   single-use plastics (SUPs) by means of a structured survey with
   additional semi-structured interviews. Our focus is on the four Atlantic
   provinces of Canada, which was the first region in Canada to implement
   provincial-wide legislation for plastic reduction at the consumer level
   in 2019. Results show strong public support (77\%, n = 838) for bans of
   SUP bags at the consumer level, and for further plastic pollution
   reduction legislation. However, the level of support differed between
   regions and by demographics. Semi-structured interviews show that
   decision makers should increase efforts in raising consumer awareness
   and standardizing regulations across jurisdictions for smoother
   transitions prior to legislative action.},

Abstract = {To address the global problem of single-use plastic waste, tailored
   behavior change interventions need to be developed which respond to the
   way different audiences think and act. The current study adopted a
   behavior-based segmentation approach, underpinned by the theory of
   normative social behavior and empirical testing, to better understand
   plastic consumption and the effect of existing media communications.
   Using a sample of 1001 respondents, Two-Step Cluster Analysis identified
   two key consumer types: ``Plastic Avoiders{''} and ``Plastic Users.{''}
   The two groups differed significantly on demographic characteristics,
   media use/exposure, and theoretical constructs. The most important
   predictors of group membership were self-efficacy and work status. An
   experiment involving pre-existing environmental media communications
   revealed that perceptions, intentions, and behaviors were influenced
   differently across the two audiences. The findings suggest that
   mobilizing existing media content may provide a cost-effective way for
   environmental communicators to increase their public impact while
   avoiding unintended consequences.},

Abstract = {Plastic pollution control has been on top of the political agenda in
   China. In January 2020, China announced a phased ban on the production
   and usage of various types of single-use plastics as a solution to
   environmental pollution problems. However, the outbreak of COVID-19
   seems to be a new obstacle to the ban on single-use plastic products. To
   basically satisfied the daily necessities and contain the spread of
   SARS-CoV-2 under the background of the regular epidemic prevention and
   control in China, online ordering, contactless delivery and wearing mask
   have become an important and feasible way of daily life. However, the
   unrestrained use of disposable plastic bags, lunch boxes and masks
   within the nationwide quarantine leads to hundreds of millions of
   plastics wastes every day. The potential environmental pollution caused
   by the use of disposable plastic products during the pandemic should
   arouse social concern. The Chinese government should manage
   environmental protection in parallel with anti-pandemic endeavors as the
   situation of the pandemic evolves.},

Title = {COVID-19 pandemic repercussions on plastic and antiviral polymeric
   textile causing pollution on beaches and coasts of South America},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide has been alarming in
   the last months. According to recommendations of the World Health
   Organization (WHO), the use of face masks is essential for slowing down
   the transmission rate of COVID-19 in human beings. This pandemic has
   generated a substantial increase in the use, as well as in the
   production, of face masks and other elements (gloves, face protectors,
   protective suits, safety shoes) manufactured with polymeric materials,
   including antiviral textiles most of which will end as microplastic
   pools. Focusing on South America, the use and mismanagement of this type
   of personal protective equipment (PPE) represents an environmental
   problem. Added to this issue are the increase in the use of single-use
   plastic, and the reduction of plastic recycling due to the curfew
   generated by the pandemic, further aggravating plastic pollution on
   coasts and beaches. Recently, researchers have developed antiviral
   polymeric textile technology composed of Ag and Cu nanoparticles for PPE
   to reduce the contagion and spread of COVID-19. Antiviral polymeric
   textile wastes could also have long-term negative repercussions on
   aquatic environments, as they are an important emerging class of
   contaminants. For this reason, this work provides reflections and
   perspectives on how the COVID-19 pandemic can aggravate plastic
   pollution on beaches and coastal environments, consequently increasing
   the damage to marine species in the coming years. In addition, the
   potential impact of the pandemic on waste management systems is
   discussed here, as well as future research directions to improve
   integrated coastal management strategies. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {The Uptake of Container Deposit Schemes: A Case Study in Perth, Western
   Australia},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The environmental impacts of single-use plastics are increasing
   worldwide due to the continual rise in consumption and a lack of
   appropriate collection and management systems in many countries. Various
   programs, known as container deposit schemes (CDS), have been
   implemented to improve the collection and recycling of single-use
   plastic containers. This research investigated the drivers and barriers
   of CDS uptake in Perth, Western Australia. The study surveyed over 400
   individuals within Perth regarding their engagement with and usage of
   the local CDS, known as ``Containers for Change{''}, which was
   implemented in October 2020. This research found that there is a high
   level of public awareness (98\%) of the scheme, and it has been widely
   adopted across Perth within the first year of its implementation;
   however, logistical challenges and container eligibility were found to
   be key barriers to the uptake of the scheme. It was noted that there is
   some skepticism toward waste management practices in Australia, and
   knowledge of the benefits of CDS appears to be lacking. Recommendations
   for improving the functionality and uptake of the Containers for Change
   scheme are to increase the range of bottles accepted within the scheme,
   create more accessible and convenient drop-off locations for containers,
   and improve/increase education regarding the benefits of the scheme.
   This research is limited by a response rate that was dominated by
   individuals living in stand-alone houses; however, with the majority of
   Perth residents living in stand-alone houses, this research remains
   valuable. There is scope for further research into skepticism regarding
   waste management practices in Australia, as well as the logistical
   challenges of CDS uptake by apartment dwellers.},

Abstract = {Packaging ensures the safe handling and distribution of fresh and
   processed food products via diverse supply chains, and has become an
   indispensable component of the food industry. However, the rapidly
   expanding use of plastics, especially single-use plastics, as packaging
   material leads to inadequate waste management, littering, and
   consequently serious environmental damage, which predominantly affects
   marine and freshwater sources. Thus, the use of plastics for packaging
   purposes has become a major public concern and hence a concern among
   global policymakers. Notably, 26\% of the total volume of global plastic
   production is primarily used for packaging, of which single-use plastics
   account for 50\%, resulting in pollution that may last hundreds of
   years. This review provides an overview of the manner in which molded
   pulp products can be utilized to improve sustainability of food
   packaging applications, by highlighting the manufacturing processes,
   signifying characteristics features of recyclable molded pulp, and
   coupling circularity with eco-friendly and safe food product packaging.
   In this regard, current concepts advocate the implementation of a
   dynamic and sustainable approach using molded pulp products. This
   approach encompasses the design and production of eco-friendly
   packaging, distribution and consumption of packaged products, and
   collection and recycling of used packaging for subsequent reuse.},

Title = {Optimized production of single-use plastic-Eucalyptus wood char
   composite for application in soil},

Abstract = {Co-pyrolysis of Eucalyptus wood (EW) and Single-use plastic (SUP) can be
   a sustainable and green technological option ensuring optimum resource
   recovery and plastic waste management in a circular economy. This study
   aims to optimize the variables of pyrolysis {[}temperature (300, 400,
   500, 600 degrees C), residence time (90, 120, 150 min), and proportion
   of plastic (w/w - 0.25, 0.33)] for application of SUP EW char composite
   in soil. Statistical analysis showed that all three process variables
   had significant influence on properties of the char. With temperature
   and residence time, the char became dense, carbonaceous, ash-rich,
   aromatic, and alkaline for both the proportions of SUP in the feed.
   Further characterization also revealed that the highest plant
   extractable concentrations of major nutrients, cation exchange capacity,
   and electrical conductivity of char composite were recorded with
   temperatures of 400-500 degrees C, residence time of 120 min, and 33\%
   (w/w) of SUP. The surface morphology analysis revealed the char to have
   a porous structure with a coating of plastic at lower temperatures of
   300 degrees C and an increase in microporosity at higher temperatures of
   500, 600 degrees C. Significant positive correlations between radicle
   root growth and prominent plant growth parameters observed through seed
   germination test indicate the char's potential applicability in soil.
   The optimized process parameters of char obtained through regression
   modeling for application in soil were 415.2 degrees C, 125.2 min, and
   0.325 (w/w) proportion of SUP. The highest mean seed length of
   approximate to 17.5 cm observed at 400 degrees C, 120 min, and 0.33
   (w/w) proportion of SUP was consistent with these optimized parameters.
   Soil incubation test further showed that amendment with optimized char
   composite significantly improved its properties with a 3.7-fold increase
   in soil fertility index at 5\% rate of application. So, the application
   of optimized SUP - EW char composite could significantly improve the
   properties of soil while promoting greener sustainable development
   through ideal utilization of the so far mismanaged waste resources. (C)

Title = {COVID pollution: impact of COVID-19 pandemic on global plastic waste
   footprint},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Plastic products have played significant roles in protecting people
   during the COVID-19 pandemic. The widespread use of personal protective
   gear created a massive disruption in the supply chain and waste disposal
   system. Millions of discarded single-use plastics (masks, gloves,
   aprons, and bottles of sanitizers) have been added to the terrestrial
   environment and could cause a surge in plastics washing up the ocean
   coastlines and littering the seabed. This paper attempts to assess the
   environmental footprints of the global plastic wastes generated during
   COVID-19 and analyze the potential impacts associated with plastic
   pollution. The amount of plastic wastes generated worldwide since the
   outbreak is estimated at 1.6 million tonnes/day. We estimate that
   approximately 3.4 billion single-use facemasks/face shields are
   discarded daily as a result of COVID-19 pandemic, globally. Our
   comprehensive data analysis does indicate that COVID-19 will reverse the
   momentum of years-long global battle to reduce plastic waste pollution.
   As governments are looking to turbo-charge the economy by supporting
   businesses weather the pandemic, there is an opportunity to rebuild new
   industries that can innovate new reusable or non-plastic PPEs. The
   unanticipated occurrence of a pandemic of this scale has resulted in
   unmanageable levels of biomedical plastic wastes. This expert insight
   attempts to raise awareness for the adoption of dynamic waste management
   strategies targeted at reducing environmental contamination by plastics
   generated during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {Polylactide (PLA) is both bio-based and biodegradable and has therefore
   attracted increased attention for single-use plastics applications.
   Under the context of the recent EU Plastics and Bioeconomy strategies,
   this study uses life cycle assessment (LCA) to assess the environmental
   footprint of single-use drinking cups made from PLA, including 13
   environmental impact categories. Land use changes (LUCs) were assessed
   based on a deterministic model. The manufacturing phase was modeled
   based on primary production data stemming directly from the industry.
   The end-of-life (EoL) impacts were assessed using the EASETECH. PLA cups
   were then compared with their petrochemical counterparts polyethylene
   terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) cups. Based on the available
   data quality of the petrochemical polymers, six impact categories were
   compared. For PLA cups, the process energy use in the conversion from
   biomass to PLA polymer was identified as the main environmental hotspot,
   followed by the electricity consumption of thermoforming of the cups. It
   was found that the biomass acquisition phase has a limited overall
   impact. LUCs contribute to a negligible impact in all impact categories
   except for climate change and photochemical ozone formation. Compared to
   PET cups, the current PLA cups offer environmental impact savings for
   climate change even including the impacts of LUC. Compared to both PET
   and PP cups, PLA cups offer savings for fossil fuels resource use but
   lead to higher impacts for photochemical ozone formation, acidification
   and terrestrial eutrophication.},

Title = {Matrix Trays: From waste to opportunities},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {300},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Matrix Trays are single-use plastic carriers used to transport
   integrated chips and circuit board components during automated test and
   assembly processes for Printed Circuit Boards. These trays represent a
   significant yet consistent waste stream; primarily in the electronics
   industry and many other industries that integrate microchips into their
   products especially the automotive industry. By the end of 2017, the
   National Sword Policy which was implemented by China on plastic waste
   import from other countries and especially the United States catalyzed a
   huge crisis and forced manufacturers and companies to deal with their
   own plastic waste streams. This study presents two alternative
   approaches of reusing trays to the reduced conventional recycling
   practices which have caused used trays to remain in storage or be
   deposited in landfills. Approaches including a students' design
   competition and a proof of concept case study for an autonomous shading
   device are presented. The shading device was designed, tested and
   validated. Trays were transformed from waste into 13 possible products
   showing that a circular economy and industrial symbiosis can be achieved
   by integrating multidisciplinary reuse approaches for byproduct reuse
   and sustainable industry practices. Environmental and economic impacts
   were evaluated comparing reuse to recycling, combustion and landfilling.
   The results showed that reusing trays reduces energy consumption and
   greenhouse gas emissions. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Opportunities for single-use plastic reduction in the food service
   sector during COVID-19},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Pages = {1082-1094},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic caused a surge in consumption of single-use
   plastics (SUPs), particularly in the food service sector, due to
   concerns for public health and safety. To follow public health
   guidelines, food services have been limited to takeout service and have
   restricted use of personal reusable items. This study investigated
   opportunities to reduce increased use of SUPs in Nova Scotia food
   services sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic using semi-structured
   interviews and focus groups with stakeholders from the food service
   sector. Many participants had already implemented SUP reduction
   strategies prior to COVID-19. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced
   businesses to rely on SUPs and to pause SUP reduction strategies.
   Obstacles to SUP reduction included operational challenges from COVID-19
   restrictions, misunderstanding of local waste management systems, costs
   of transitioning to zero plastic waste, poorly manufactured
   alternatives, greenwashing, and ingrained societal convenience culture.
   Whilst not all SUP consumption patterns were attributed to COVID-19,
   these barriers prevented food retailers, waste managers and consumers
   from achieving zero-plastic waste goals. Food services should adopt SUP
   reduction strategies, including re-introducing reusables, implementing
   exchange programs for bulk items and takeout, providing education and
   awareness to staff and consumers, and sourcing sustainable SUP
   alternatives. SUP reduction strategies can be implemented immediately as
   public health officials and researchers agree reusable items can be used
   safely when using basic hygiene measures. Food services across Nova
   Scotia should adapt their operational procedures and create behaviour
   change to reduce SUPs.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown situation have shown both positive
   and negative effects on the environmental aspects. With an unprecedented
   rate the different types of waste volume have up surged along with the
   COVID-19 contamination rate. As the situation has mandated people as
   well as the most infected persons to stay at home, the amount of
   generated hazardous waste is 3.40 kg that can be expected daily from
   each infected person. China and other countries have seen a massive
   increment in the hazardous waste generation (about 600 \% increase in
   Hubei province) amount. While dealing with this sudden increase in waste
   amount, the conventional incineration facilities have been outstripped
   and waste management industry is facing an immense pressure over
   handling hazardous waste generated from COVID-19 infected patients.
   Alongside with the hazardous waste volume, single-use plastic items and
   personal protective equipment (PPEs) have induced a new type of ``PPE
   pollution{''} in the land and aquatic environment. The current review
   provides a countrywide waste generation amount, estimated using the
   infected number of cases for some selected countries. In contrast with
   the poor waste management noticed during this pandemic, some suggested
   approaches towards a better waste management service and future
   implications of waste management are discussed with viable consideration
   for the waste workers.},

Title = {Carbon footprint reduction potential of waste management strategies in
   tourism},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Tourism is one of the major economic factors contributing to growth and
   jobs worldwide. The number of international travellers has increased
   more than 50-fold in the past 70 years. However, the contribution of
   tourism to (municipal) waste generation is also large and is increasing,
   accompanied by an increase in some environmental and socio-economic
   impacts. An average value of 1.67 kg waste is now generated per tourist
   (Obersteiner et al., 2017). Waste prevention and recycling should
   therefore be major objectives in tourist waste management by municipal
   authorities.
   Within the EU H2020-funded project ``URBANWASTE - Urban Strategies for
   Waste Management in Tourist Cities{''}, eco-innovative waste prevention
   and management strategies were implemented in 10 pilot cities with high
   levels of tourism, in order to reduce urban waste production and improve
   municipal waste management. This study examined the potential greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions savings for three selected waste prevention and
   treatment options: food waste prevention, reductions in single use
   plastic and increased separate collection and recycling of waste.
   Benefits were expressed per kg waste prevented or diverted higher up the
   waste hierarchy and per 1000 tourists.
   The measures achieved potential GHG emission savings of between 4 and
   189 kg CO2-eq. per 1000 tourists, depending on local conditions such as
   the existing waste management system. Measures tackling food waste
   reduction and separate collection had low emissions associated with the
   measure itself, whereas for assessed measures reducing the use of single
   use plastics by providing reusable alternatives, emissions associated
   with the measures were relatively high. This was due to the emissions
   associated with the production of the alternative reusable products.
   Influencing factors reducing the carbon footprint of waste management in
   tourism other than the kind of waste focused on were the existing waste
   management system (especially for biowaste) as well as the
   practicability and scalability of measures under the divers regional
   circumstances.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 outbreak has boosted demand for and use of personal
   protective equipment (PPE) and other single-use plastics, adding to the
   environment's already high levels of plastic pollution and endangering
   biota. Estimating the relative abundance of PPE wastes that end up in
   the environment is crucial and has remained a challenge for COVID-19
   researchers. Citizen science has been utilized in recent studies to
   monitor and collect data using volunteers, and it has proven to be a
   valuable approach even in difficult situations. The expansion of citizen
   scientific participation groups is important in light of the growing
   anthropogenic impacts of plastic pollution. To date, frontline sanitary
   personnel are often overlooked and underutilized in a citizen science
   perspective, yet they serve critical roles in maintaining cleanliness in
   key environmental settings (e.g., beaches and streets) both during and
   beyond the pandemic. This paper explores and emphasizes the advantages
   and need of including frontline sanitary personnel into citizen science
   for the benefit of both researchers and communities, as well as to
   encourage long-term goals in global plastic litter monitoring, thereby
   exemplifying citizen science opportunities. Recommendations are made to
   design in order to improve the future status of citizen science
   development.},

Abstract = {A large amount of non-infected plastic wastes are being generated at the
   healthcare facilities all over the world. However, only a small fraction
   is recycled. Conventionally, the used plastics are either disposed in
   landfills or inadequately incinerated. These practices impart an adverse
   effect on our environment. Plastics are indispensable part of the
   medical sector owing to their high versatility. The outbreak of COVID-19
   clearly showed the growing demand for single use plastics. Hence,
   completely avoiding plastics can be challenging at this point of time.
   Recycling of plastics is undoubtedly a solution to solve the crisis of
   plastic pollution. Medical plastic recycling is limited mainly due to
   difficulties involved in sorting or cleaning. Recycling medical plastic
   wastes is possible only through proper coordination between healthcare
   sector and recycling industries. New recycling technologies are to be
   adopted in a sustainable manner. Moreover, the plastics used in medical
   applications should be designed such that recycling is possible. This
   review highlights the downside of medical wastes and discusses the
   recycling potential of commonly used medical plastics. (c) 2021 Kingfa

Abstract = {Plastic waste is a global environmental problem. However, management
   solutions must be developed within local, institutional contexts. This
   paper considers the Government of Canada's `proposed integrated
   management approach to plastic products' both as a strategy for
   management and as an expression of federal jurisdiction. What is the
   policy problem to which they are responding, and how are they
   characterizing that problem in order to claim jurisdiction? Most
   importantly, what are the policy implications of this jurisdictional

Abstract = {In the case of plastic waste regulations, this framework ignores that
   recycling in developing countries is largely undertaken within the
   unorganised sector. To add to this policies such as Single Use Plastic
   (SUP) bans disproportionately penalise unorganised sector recycling
   units and workers employed within them. This paper seeks to identify the
   global framework of waste minimisation and the lacunae in its
   implementation in the case of plastic waste in India. This will be based
   on analysis of national level regulations on plastic waste, court cases
   in the High Courts of India, and results of a primary field survey of
   unorganised sector plastic recycling units in Mumbai. By doing so, this
   paper seeks to explain the importance of recycling as a productive
   activity, and the need to incorporate concerns of workers and
   small-scale enterprise owners from the unorganised sector, in order to
   achieve a just transition to sustainable plastic waste management.},

Abstract = {Purpose The use of single use plastic items and plastic wrapping has
   increased over the last number of decades. Outside of the medical field
   there has been a conscious drive to reduce single use plastic and reuse
   items to reduce the amount of waste we produce. We undertook this
   investigation to quantify our plastic waste production and generate
   ideas to reduce this volume. Methodology Data was collected from a
   University Hospital ENT outpatient department via real-time recording
   methods using standard data collection forms. We measured plastic unit
   usage pre and post COVID restrictions and compared this to our number of
   patient encounters. Projections of plastic usage were determined via a
   hypothetical resumption of patient services model. Results In total
   there were 440 patients included. In period one the mean units of
   plastic used per day was 65.1 (median 67; range 27-84). In the second
   period, the mean number of plastic units was 23.4 (median 22; range
   1-7). Blue nitrile gloves and masks were the most commonly used single
   use items. The hypothetical projection model predicted a 147.6\%
   increase in single use items following the introduction of COVID
   precautions. Conclusion We have a duty of care not only to our patients
   but future generations of patients and the environment which we share.
   Single use items and excessive plastic wrapping have benefits in terms
   of convenience and sterility, but these conveniences can be easily
   extended to reusable types to limit our volume of waste, reduce our
   waste management costs and protect our environment.},

Abstract = {The devastating impacts that bio-degradable products such as plastic
   bags are having on human health, wildlife, and the environment is
   enormous, especially single-use once. Single-use plastics are
   non-biodegradable products and does not undergo biological decomposition
   nor degenerate. This review examines various government regulations
   targeted at changing behaviour against plastic bags consumption and
   their effectiveness. Following a rigorous search in 13 databases,
   including PubMed, Science Direct, Springer Nature, etc. only 17
   peer-reviewed journal articles that are published between 2000 and 2019
   and met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. Each study's
   methodological quality was assessed using the GRADE system, and data
   were extracted using a uniquely designed form. The results revealed that
   regulations based solely on the thickness of plastic bags does not
   reduce plastic bags consumption. However, regulations focused on banning
   `single-use' plastic bag usage, imposing higher taxes and levies on
   consumers, significantly reduce plastic bags consumption. Overall, the
   latter is considered the most effective. Also, the results show that
   attitude, perception and behaviour change toward bio-degradable products
   or climate-friendly behaviour can be significantly influenced by public
   policy or regulations. Although the behaviour seems short-lived in some
   countries, therefore further studies need to probe on why. Also, the
   absence of a national regulatory strategy in North America reduced the
   inclusion of studies from the region, hence need for more research
   focusing on sub-national regulations.},

Title = {Plastic Drawdown: A rapid assessment tool for developing national
   responses to plastic pollution when data availability is limited, as
   demonstrated in the Maldives},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},

Abstract = {Governments are increasingly supporting initiatives to address plastic
   pollution, but efforts are largely opportunistic or driven by national
   socio-political priorities. There is an urgent need to move away from
   piecemeal single product instruments (e.g. single use plastic bag taxes
   or plastic straw bans) to deliver system-wide strategies that minimise
   the most pervasive sources of plastic pollution. Developing a common
   understanding of a jurisdiction's plastic waste stream and the solutions
   available to decision-makers is vital to build consensus across
   stakeholders and to align on an evidence-based portfolio of priority
   instruments. This paper presents the Plastic Drawdown framework as a
   boundary-spanning tool to quickly create a coherent, relevant, and
   credible analysis and visualisation for stakeholders of plastic waste,
   leakage hotspots and minimisation opportunities. Using a new plastic
   waste modelling framework with a consultative structure, Plastic
   Drawdown explores plastic waste and leakage over a ten-year period and
   assesses impacts of policy instruments on this projection. Plastic
   Drawdown is adaptable to the data poor environment typical of many
   countries and designed as a rapid assessment tool to support the
   decision making of governments operating in a highly
   resource-constrained context. The Maldives is used as a case study to
   show the utility of the tool, where it highlighted strategies with the
   potential to reduce leakage of plastic waste into the marine environment
   by up to 85\% by 2030. Plastic Drawdown built the case for phasing out
   single-use plastic waste across the Maldives and supported the
   Government's decision to set ambitious targets, as announced at the
   United Nations General Assembly in 2019.},

Abstract = {The demand to develop and produce eco-friendly alternatives for food
   packaging is increasing. The huge negative impact that the disposal of
   so-called ``single-use plastics{''} has on the environment is propelling
   the market to search for new solutions, and requires initiatives to
   drive faster responses from the scientific community, the industry, and
   governmental bodies for the adoption and implementation of new
   materials. Bioplastics are an alternative group of materials that are
   partly or entirely produced from renewable sources. Some bioplastics are
   biodegradable or even compostable under the right conditions. This
   review presents the different properties of these materials, mechanisms
   of biodegradation, and their environmental impact, but also presents a
   holistic overview of the most important bioplastics available in the
   market and their potential application for food packaging, consumer
   perception of the bioplastics, regulatory aspects, and future
   challenges.},

Title = {Reconfiguring the everyday: plastic waste as performance art in
   addressing the incongruity between the `talk' and the `walk' in the

Abstract = {Despite the attention drawn to the plastic crisis by the media and
   environmental campaigns, much of the practice around single-use plastic
   has remained unchanged. It appears that, although many know the correct
   position to assume regarding the issue, the `talk' does not necessarily
   translate into action. This incongruity can be explained with reference
   to Heidegger's theory on the everydayness of discourse which suggests
   that a lack of authenticity underlies our everyday interactions and that
   what is needed is a different kind of encounter with the world. In the
   light of this we consider Ranciere's theory on the potential of a
   political artwork to disrupt the everyday and prompt a different
   response. Within the framework of these theories, this paper discusses a
   performance artwork protesting plastic pollution - namely 12 Plastic
   Monsters by Luke Rudman - as an alternative strategy to prompt a fresh
   engagement with the issue.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastics used for food packaging have increased significantly
   environmental pollution. There is a global need to improve the
   sustainability of our packaging solutions by designing smart
   biodegradable polymers. In this work, we demonstrate a completely green,
   facile two-steps route to produce an antibacterial Poly(vinyl alcohol)
   (PVA) film for packaging by using N-Acetylcysteine (NAC). PVA is a
   biopolymer with good compatibility, processability, and is degradable in
   water. NAC is known in medicine and nutrition for its antioxidant and
   antibacterial effects. Here we show how PVA films enriched with NAC
   (PVA-NAC) are mechanical resistant and at the same time exhibit strong
   UV light shielding. NAC is released from films and inhibits E. coli and
   S. aureus microorganisms growth. The developed PVA-NAC films are soluble
   in water and can be considered as a promising substitute for polluting
   plastic packaging.},

   plastic-based PPE with efficient recycling and waste disposal methods
   should be adopted as interim strategies till more sustainable solutions
   are designed and implemented. Redesigning plastic production decoupled

Title = {Assessing threats, regulations, and strategies to abate plastic
   pollution in LAC beaches during COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {208},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Plastic use and production have dramatically increased globally over the
   past 65 years with the improvement of life quality by the daily use of
   plastic products. Still, around 50\% of the plastic produced is
   disposable products that generate substantial waste. Several reports
   pointed out the adverse effects of plastic litter in coastal
   environments in recent years, emphasizing single-use plastics (SUP). In
   this manner, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) coastal environments
   are highly vulnerable due to wastewater treatment facilities scarcity
   and poor plastic waste management strategies. Since COVID-19 pandemic,
   the single-use plastic waste/person rate is expected to rise due to the
   use of personal protective equipment and SUP as health care measures.
   Based on literature research and the review of plastic waste
   regulations, this paper will assess the main COVID-19 plastic pollution
   threats and LAC beaches' regulations to suggest possible measures to
   abate this problem. The main findings suggest that unifying the ongoing
   fragmented and overlapped policies is key to abate plastic pollution,
   including plastic industry regulations and circular economies. In
   addition, increasing public risk perception about plastic pollution is
   critical to reducing plastic waste generation. Research advances in the
   adverse effects of plastic debris could improve the public's perception
   of plastic pollution risk, pushing forward global marine plastic
   governance.},

Abstract = {Marine plastic pollution causes adverse effects on global environment
   and marine ecosystems, particularly in marine protected areas. However,
   little is known of the effects of marine plastic debris on marine
   ecosystem services, human wellbeing, society, and the economy. We
   selected Phu Quoc Marine Protected Area (Phu Quoc MPA) for gaining an
   insight into current marine plastic debris as a first step towards
   understanding its effects on the environment and biodiversity in the
   region. This study applied secondary data analysis, semi-structured
   interviews, field measurements, and the quadrate line transect method in
   pursuit of the objective of the study. The findings reveal that marine
   plastic debris disposed of in Phu Quoc MPA dominantly came from diverse
   sources including rivers, streams, canals, tourism service providers,
   and marine aquaculture development areas. The abundance of macroplastic
   on the beaches was approximately between 1.109 and 0.248 items/m2
   (equivalent to 0.082 +/- 0.021 kg/m(2)). Most of the macroplastic were
   single-use plastics and accounted for more than 82\%. The average size
   was approximately 14.932 +/- 1.846 cm for items less than 30 cm. The
   remaining ones were HDPE plastic bags and plastic debris. The
   macroplastic and microplastic need to be stopped in order to encourage
   sustainable management of waste in the region.},

Abstract = {The global accumulation of single-use plastic bags made from
   nonbiodegradable plastics is the most concerning environmental issue
   nowadays. The utilization of biodegradable materials is a choice to
   reduce the environmental impact resulting from the use of plastic
   products. The utilization of renewable resources to produce fully
   biodegradable plastics is among the technologies used to overcome
   petroleum plastic's negative impact. On the other hand, the utilization
   of oxo-biodegradable plastics where prodegradant additives are
   incorporated in conventional plastics to promote their degradation under
   certain conditions has recently received much attention. This review
   discusses the types and challenges that face the implementation of
   biodegradable plastics technology that uses renewable resources. This
   review also covers the debate addressed in the literature about the
   biodegradability fate of oxo-biodegradable plastic in the air, compost,
   soil, landfill, and marine. A comparative study included the potential
   published literature in the last 10 years was performed. Based on the
   discussed evidence in this review, it can be concluded that all
   literature agrees that the addition of pro-oxidant/prodegradants can
   accelerate the degradation of oxo-plastics to small fragments. However,
   the complete biodegradation of oxo-plastics by microorganisms remains in
   doubt. On the other hand, biopolymers produced from natural resources
   seem to be the future direction for plastics manufacturing especially
   single-use plastic bags.},

Abstract = {Plastics are excellent materials owing to their multipurpose uses. They
   are simple synthetic macromolecules with versatile properties. On the
   disposal front, nearly 90\% of the plastic products are discarded only
   after a single use, which keeps accumulating, impacting both terrestrial
   and marine life. About 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste have
   accumulated worldwide from the time of the plastic revolution. Around
   79\% of plastic waste amasses in landfills every year, and 2.41 million
   tonnes of the waste enters oceans. The accumulation of this waste poses
   harmful threats to the environment and flora and fauna of land and
   aquatic habitats. To keep a check on the generation and collection of
   plastic waste, the utilization of alternative materials developed from
   biodegradable polymers as substitutes to plastics seems quite sound. The
   present perspective highlights single use plastic's (SUP) challenges and
   the importance of biodegradable polymers as possible substitutes to
   SUPs. The scope of different biodegradable polymers and their
   suitability for developing alternative materials to SUPs is discussed.
   In addition, the current market status of alternative materials produced
   from biodegradable polymers is described. Finally, a perspective on the
   future of biodegradable polymers as substitutes to plastics for
   envisaging a green world is outlined.},

Abstract = {Environmental issues have been growing due to the increased use of
   plastics and follow-up waste generation during the COVID-19 pandemic. To
   protect the patients, public, healthcare workers and waste management
   workers, many plastic protective gears are being extensively used
   throughout the world. These result in an unexpected increase of
   virus-laden infectious waste that needs to be managed properly.
   Moreover, during this pandemic period, single-use plastic is also
   bounced back which could deteriorate our waste management processes.
   These factors are overwhelming the current waste treatment facilities
   and the health authorities are making a lot of efforts to ameliorate the
   waste management process. In this article, information on generated
   waste, guidelines issued by various countries, and challenges and
   practices for safe disposal of infectious waste is provided to mitigate
   such waste management issues in future.},

   demographic profile, describing the level of awareness on single-use
   plastic in relation to plastic ban legislation and threats to the
   environment; it ascertains the consistency of practice on plastic waste
   avoidance; establishing the relationship of awareness on single-use
   plastic and sustainability in practice; and finally, the paper suggests
   the approaches to enhance the awareness and consistency of practice in
   promoting sustainable development. The analysis of the survey results
   from 890 participants during May-July 2021 from different ethnicities
   concludes that among others, a higher level of plastic pollution-related
   awareness and knowledge along with positive attitude and skills for its
   control, increases the adoption of plastic waste management practices.
   Based on the synthesis of participants' suggestions, this paper proposes
   a set of six interconnected approaches to address the plastics wastes
   and its impact on the environment, useful for practitioners,
   policymakers, and researchers in this area.},

Title = {Life cycle assessment of the co-combustion system of single-use plastic
   waste and lignite coal to promote circular economy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {329},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {Single-use plastics waste is a thermosetting-thermoplastic polymer
   generated specifically from packaging industries. Incineration,
   landfilling, combustion, open discharge in liquids fail its effective
   disposal. Co-combustion via co-processing is a novel technique for
   disposal. In this study, investigative thermogravimetric analysis of the
   co-combustion of lignite coal (AL) and single-use plastic waste (PW) in
   the blend ratios of 50:50, 60:40, 70:30 was carried out under
   non-isothermal conditions to promote co-combustion via co-processing
   technique for environment-friendly disposal. Thermal degradation
   behavioral study was carried out at higher blending ratios of 30-50\%.
   The effect of the mass ratio of PW to AL on co-combustion
   characteristics was analyzed. The Freeman-Carroll, Sharp-Wentworth
   methods derived energy of activation for the process of co-combustion in
   the limits of 65-155 kJ/mol, 44-75 kJ/mol. Volume Contracting and
   Diffusional Reaction 2D solid-state reaction mechanisms were followed by
   the co-combustion system as derived by Coats-Redfern and Kennedy-Clark
   methods. Master plot method validated the same results. The
   co-combustion performance was evaluated using co-combustion (CSI),
   ignition (IG), burnout (IB) indices. The highest CSI value was reported
   for the 60:40 blend. Burnout temperature (T-b) decreased with an
   increase in blending ratio and suggested an effective co-combustion
   process. Blend (70:30) reported the highest interaction in blends and
   confirmed the synergistic effect. The principal component analysis
   described the co-combustion process as three stages (100-200, 265-425,
   425-700)degrees C with specific materials. The co-combustion process was
   optimized using the methodology of surface response and validated using
   neural network models (NNM 4,5) for the effect of temperature and blend
   ratio on mass loss. The characterization study confirmed the presence of
   minerals alumino-silicates, dimorphs pyrite, marcasite, gypsum, barite,
   hydrated sulfates, calcite, siderite, and functional groups -OH, -CH2,
   -Si-O responsible for autocatalytic reactions. Life cycle assessment
   confirmed the sustainability of the co-combustion process of lignite and
   plastic waste. The present study benefits for scale-up, optimization,
   waste to energy conversion, pollution reduction, and environmentally
   friendly disposal via the co-combustion process.},

Title = {Advances in barrier coatings and film technologies for achieving
   sustainable packaging of food products-A review},
Journal = {TRENDS IN FOOD SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},

Abstract = {Background: The technology of food packaging is responding to
   significant market dynamics such as the rapid growth in e-commerce and
   preservation of fresh food, a sector that accounts for over 40\% of
   plastic waste. Further, mandates for sustainability and recent changes
   in national governmental policies and regulations that include banning
   single-use plastic products as observed in sweeping reforms in Europe,
   Asia, and several US States are forcing industries and consumers to find
   alternative solutions. Scope and approach: This review highlights an
   ongoing shift of barrier coatings from traditional synthetic polymers to
   sustainable breakthrough materials for paper-based packaging and films.
   Advantages, challenges and adapting feasibility of these materials are
   described, highlighting the implications of selecting different
   materials and processing options. A brief description on progress in
   methods of coating technologies is also included. Finally, the end fate
   of the barrier materials is classified depending on the packaging type,
   coating materials used and sorting facility availability. Key findings
   and conclusions: Different types of coatings, such as water-based
   biopolymers, due to their greater environmental compatibility, are
   making inroads into more traditional petroleum-based wax and plastic
   laminate paperboard products for fresh food bakery, frozen food, and
   take-out containers applications. In addition, nano-biocomposites have
   been studied at an accelerating pace for developing active and smart
   packaging. Based on the momentum of recent developments, a strong pace
   of continuing developments in the field can be expected.},

Abstract = {To date, life cycle assessment (LCA) does not include a methodology for
   assessing the impacts of plastic litter leaked to the environment. This
   limits the applicability of LCA as a tool to compare the potential
   impacts of single-use plastics and their alternatives on ecosystem
   quality and human health. As a contribution to tackle this issue, this
   work proposes simplified fate and characterization factors (CFs) for
   modeling the impacts of two types of microplastics-expanded polystyrene
   and tire and road wear particles-in the marine environment. In terms of
   fate mechanisms, this work explores different sedimentation,
   degradation, and fragmentation rate scenarios, based on literature
   values and expert estimates. Whereas the fate of expanded polystyrene is
   sensitive to the different fragmentation, degradation, and sedimentation
   scenarios, for tire and road wear particles the fate is primarily
   sensitive to sedimentation. The fate factors are integrated into CFs
   using an existing exposure and effect factor for microplastics in
   aquatic environments. Since the CFs of the two studied microplastics
   show important differences, these results reveal the need for developing
   polymer-specific CFs. Finally, the CFs are tested in a case study of
   on-the-go food containers (one single-use plastic, two compostable
   alternatives, and one reusable plate). Depending on the fate scenario,
   plastic litter impacts range from barely noticeable to more than
   doubling the total potential damage to ecosystem quality, compared to no
   plastic litter impact assessment. The high uncertainty of the results
   encourages further research on modeling microplastic fate and impacts in
   detail.},

Abstract = {Compared to the influence of social norms on pro-environmental behavior,
   we know much less about the processes that influence perceptions about
   social norms. This study explores the relationship between media
   exposure and social norms in the context of single-use plastic
   avoidance. Structural equation modeling was used to determine how
   exposure to news, documentaries, and social media were related to key
   constructs from the theory of normative social behavior - including
   perceived descriptive and injunctive norms and outcome expectations
   related to perceived self- and environmental benefits of avoidance. News
   exposure was positively related to injunctive norms. Social media
   exposure was negatively related to descriptive and injunctive norms and
   positively related to perceived benefits. Documentary exposure was
   positively related to descriptive norms and perceived benefits. The
   theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {The paper investigates spillover in the pro-environmental context of
   Australian consumers' transition to using reusable bags, and explores
   its implications for other related environmental behaviours. This study
   uses a natural time-series design (pre, during and post change measures)
   to examine a real-world instance of a forced behaviour change
   incorporating changes in people's grocery shopping habits and possible
   subsequent behaviours. The study examines attitudes and behaviours
   including spillover, environmental lifestyle and moral licencing before
   (n = 200), during (n = 342) and after (n = 346) the phase out of
   single-use plastic bags. The definition, operationalisation, and
   measurement of spillover are also explored. Despite conflicting evidence
   from previous research, our findings suggest that a forced behaviour
   change can incidentally result in changes in subsequent related
   behaviours.},

Abstract = {Regulation is often seen as a barrier to innovation. However, if done
   properly, it can actually serve as a driver of innovation. To understand
   how environmental regulation can be designed to stimulate innovation, we
   scrutinise the scientific literature related to regulation, innovation
   and the environment. Fifty one carefully selected studies are examined
   with regard to their scope, results and geographical affiliation, and
   their findings were distilled into ten lessons on how to design
   environmental regulation to stimulate innovation. Subsequently, we
   discuss the validity and implications of the lessons. We find that the
   lessons are overarching concepts of principal nature that are applicable
   for most regulatory settings. We also find that recent EU regulations on
   plastics, nanomaterials and waste support many of the lessons learned,
   while some are completely neglected. The lessons offer important
   guidance and can be seen as a checklist of what regulators must consider
   when designing new regulation.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of the plastic bag
   fee (that was implemented in Turkey recently) on the consumer behavior.
   For this purpose, a face-to-face consumer survey with 821 respondents
   was conducted in Istanbul. A paired sample t-test was carried out in
   order to compare consumers' average frequency of using plastic bags,
   bringing their own bags for shopping, using plastic bags obtained in
   shopping for domestic waste and purchasing bin bags for domestic waste
   before/after the implementation of the policy of charging for plastic
   bags. Two different multiple regression analyses were carried out to
   determine which factors affect the change in plastic bag demand by the
   consumers for when the plastic bags were free of charge and for when
   they were paid. The results suggest that there has been a statistically
   significant change in consumers' behaviors towards using plastic bags in
   shopping and the means of keeping domestic waste. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

   anthropogenic debris on Indonesian beach from the results of nationwide
   monitoring},

Abstract = {The first stranded macrodebris study on a national scale in Indonesia
   was conducted on 18 beaches from February 2018 to December 2019. The
   average weight and abundance of beach debris were higher between October
   and February (rainy season). The highest stranded macrodebris was
   located in Ambon, Manado, Takalar, and Padang. Plastic (46.38 \%) was
   the most prevalent type of debris across all macrodebris categories,
   with single-use plastics such as plastic sachets, plastic bags, and
   plastic bottles being the dominant macroplastic debris (64.64 \%). Based
   on CCI, HII, and BGI, 18 beaches are ``moderately clean, `` with few
   hazardous items observed, and ``Good. `` This anthropogenic macrodebris
   is thought to be more localized (55 \%) than transboundary mac-rodebris.
   Litter control and environmental quality of this Indonesian coastal
   region should be improved through a proactive and flexible approach.
   Finally, extensive stranded beach debris monitoring is recommended to
   better understand the distribution of macrodebris in the region.},

Abstract = {European and national environmental protection policies have programmed
   the forthcoming end of single-use plastics, including food packaging.
   Because plastic materials accounts for 50\% of plastic waste,
   closed-loop recycling seems imperative. Still, plastic recycling for
   food contact other than PET (polyethylene terephtalate) are not widely
   recycled for food contact due to safety concerns. Among them,
   postconsumer polyolefins are heavily formulated, degraded, and
   contaminated by the previously contacting product. Using recycled
   materials behind a functional barrier (FB) could resolve the issue under
   specific provisions, but neither the European regulation nor the US FDA
   offer guidance concerning functional barriers evaluation and use.
   Mathematical modeling is the only viable method recognized by European
   and American agencies to evaluate recycled material under usage
   conditions. This study numerically explores the possibility of combining
   two effects: decontamination of the recycled material and a functional
   barrier to allow safe use of the recycled material.},

Title = {COVID-19 pandemic and emerging plastic-based personal protective
   equipment waste pollution and management in Africa},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The threat of plastic waste pollution in African countries is increasing
   exponentially since the World Health Organisation declared the
   coronavirus infection as a pandemic. Fundamental to this growing threat
   are multiple factors, including the increased public consumption for
   single-use plastics, limited or non-existence of adequate plastic waste
   management infrastructures, and urbanisation. Plastics-based personal
   protective equipment including millions of surgical masks, medical
   gowns, face shields, safety glasses, protective aprons, sanitiser
   containers, plastics shoes, and gloves have been widely used for the
   reduction of exposure risk to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
   Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This paper estimates and elucidates the
   growing plethora of plastic wastes in African countries in the context
   of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
   spectral fingerprint indicates that face masks were characterised by
   natural and artificial fibres including polyester fibres, polypropylene,
   natural latex resin. Our estimate suggests that over 12 billion medical
   and fabric face masks are discarded monthly, giving the likelihood that
   an equivalent of about 105,000 tonnes of face masks per month could be
   disposed into the environment by Africans. In general, 15 out of 57
   African countries are significant plastic waste contributors with
   Nigeria (15\%), Ethiopia (8.6\%), Egypt (7.6\%), DR Congo (6.7\%),
   Tanzania (4.5\%), and South Africa (4.4\%) topping the list. Therefore,
   this expert insight is an attempt to draw the attention of governments,
   healthcare agencies, and the public to the potential risks of
   SARS-CoV-2-generated plastics (COVID plastic wastes), and the
   environmental impacts that could exacerbate the existing plastic
   pollution epidemic after the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Title = {Life cycle assessment of environmental impact of disposable drinking
   straws: A trade-off analysis with marine litter in the United States},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {817},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Sound environmental management to control marine plastic pollution
   requires a careful assessment of environmental costs and benefits of
   replacing single-use plastics with their biodegradable counterparts.
   This research employs the standard life cycle assessment (LCA) approach
   to assess and compare the environmental impact of plastic straws made
   from polypropylene (PP), and its biodegradable alternatives made from
   polylactic acid (PLA) and paper (PA) in the United States. Eight
   environmental impact categories, not including marine litter, were
   analyzed and a composite relative environmental impact index (REI) was
   derived for quantitative comparison. The results show that US daily
   consumption of disposable drinking straws (500 million straws daily) may
   carry significant environmental burdens regardless of straw types, with
   the feedstock manufacture stage of the life cycle creating most of the
   contribution. The REI index values were 2.4 for PP straws, 6.4 for PLA
   straws, and 5.1 for PA straws with landfill and 3.2 for PP straws, 6.8
   for PLA straws, and 4.9 for PA straws with incineration. A sensitivity
   analysis did not show much change in REI with increasing marine litter
   rate, demonstrating that replacing PP straws with PLA or PA straws for
   controlling marine plastic pollution would come with environmental costs
   in other categories. The trade-off can be quantitatively represented by
   the difference in REI between PP straws and PA or PLA straws. Our
   analysis also indicates close-loop recycling can greatly reduce the
   environmental impact of PP straws, serving as a technological
   development to control plastic pollution. While disposable straws were
   used as a case study in this work, the findings are extensive to other
   single-use products.},

   Strategy to Preempt Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Policies?},

Abstract = {State legislators passed laws preempting, or prohibiting, local
   governments from regulating beverage containers. Although the primary
   purpose of these laws may be to ban local environmental regulations
   addressing single-use plastics, it is unknown the extent they also
   preempt public health policies aimed at reducing sugar-sweetened
   beverage consumption. In 2021, using LexisNexis, we assessed state
   legislation preempting local control over consumer merchandise and
   containers. We identified 8 laws (and 16 failed bills) with broad
   language preempting local regulation of the sale, use, or marketing of
   multiple container types, including beverage containers. Most
   legislative activity occurred during 2016-2021, with legislative intent
   to avoid a ``patchwork{''} of local laws, avoid burdening retailers, and
   have a ``refreshing drink.{''} Local policy control was characterized as
   ``personal choice.{''} Broad preemption language may stifle local policy
   making aimed at reducing sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and
   preempt public health policies such as restricting portion size,
   in-store promotion and display, and labeling measures.},

Title = {Integrating Citizens' Importance-Performance Aspects into Sustainable
   Plastic Waste Management in Danang, Vietnam},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution is a matter of deep concern that requires an urgent
   and international response, involving stakeholders at all levels. The
   rapid increase of single-use plastic and medical waste, especially in
   the context of COVID-19, has caused a drastic progression in the plastic
   pollution crisis on a global scale. To identify an efficient plastic
   waste management (PWM) system to tackle this major environmental
   problem, this study adopted importance-performance analysis and used
   logistic regression to identify key factors affecting citizens' behavior
   to participate in PWM strategies in Vietnam. The results indicate that
   while the importance of all PWM solutions was considered to be high,
   their performance was rated at a low level, implying a sizable gap
   between perceived importance and performance of eleven solutions for
   PWM. The findings also show that solutions such as ``offering zero-waste
   lifestyle seminars to citizens{''}, ``having community engagement{''},
   ``using eco-friendly products{''}, and ``imposing a ban on single-use
   plastics{''} are useful for the development of an effective
   environmental policy. Furthermore, it was found that the following
   characteristics have a significant influence on citizens' participation
   in PWM solutions: (1) gender, (2) education level, (3) residential area,
   (4) employment status, and (5) citizens' awareness and behavior towards
   plastic reduction. This study is expected to provide theoretical and
   empirical evidence for policymakers and authorities who are in charge of
   promulgating the necessary mechanisms and policies to promote the
   socialization of PWM.},

Abstract = {Exploration vehicles can introduce vast quantities of single-use,
   plastic-coated tether that have been deliberately discarded as observed
   at the deepest site of all Earth's oceans. Manned submersible dives to
   Challenger Deep (10,925 m deep) in the Mariana Trench in 2019 and 2020
   revealed hundreds of metres of yellow and white tether strewn across the
   seafloor. Due to its composition, these fibre-optic tethers will not
   only persist environmentally, but form a significant risk to equipment
   and life should unmanned and manned craft become entangled. As a result,
   the site of the iconic first descent to the deepest place on Earth by
   Piccard and Walsh in 1960 is unlikely to be safely explored again if
   this practise continues.},

Abstract = {Due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the usage of numerous
   protective face masks has faced an explosion in demand around the world.
   Therefore, the need to reduce the environmental pollution caused by
   disposable single-use face masks has become vital. Recently, alternative
   raw material solutions have been discussed to eliminate the consumption
   of single-use plastics. Within this research, gelatin nanofibers were
   fabricated via centrifugal spinning technique, and filtration media were
   investigated in terms of air permeability and filtration efficiency. In
   addition, morphological properties were examined with scanning electron
   microscopy. Fabricated fibers have a changing average diameter range
   from 232 to 778 nm, and targeted 95\% filtration efficiency was achieved
   in several compositions. It was proven that biodegradable gelatin
   nanofibers could be a sustainable alternative for disposable N95
   respiratory filters.},

Abstract = {The massive presence of plastic in the oceans, both in the form of large
   debris and micro-plastic, is raising global concern due to its severe
   effects on the marine environment and fauna, causing loss of
   biodiversity and potentially threatening human health. Even though this
   is due to poor waste management, the great production and consumption of
   single-use plastic is a significant exacerbating factor. Despite
   policies and bans can be effective measures, there is also the need to
   raise consumers' awareness, so they can make more sustainable choices
   when purchasing, using, and dismissing products. In particular,
   educating young citizens and encouraging them to engage in
   pro-environmental behaviors is a fundamental task to reach this goal. In
   this work, we present Contact from the future, a digital game on plastic
   pollution for children, to create awareness and stimulate
   pro-environmental behaviors, discussing the definition of objectives and
   requirements, as well as the design and development of the application.},

Abstract = {Plastic pollution is an acute issue, with single-use plastic
   contributing to it significantly. It is beneficial for the planet if we
   engage in more sustainable behaviors, such as using reusable items
   instead of single-use ones, thus reducing plastic pollution. We
   implemented an intervention to increase the use of reusable coffee cups,
   by employing behavior change techniques that targeted values towards
   environment, intention to use a reusable cup, and habit. The
   intervention was successful in increasing the participants' use of
   reusable cups. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the
   acceptability of the intervention and research methods, as well as
   opinions of participants about the process and intervention
   effectiveness, using a mixed methods approach. Participants (N = 156)
   answered open and closed survey questions about the acceptability of the
   intervention, and 11 participated in interviews regarding their
   experience of intervention. The intervention was deemed acceptable and
   useful by all participants, regardless of which intervention condition
   they were allocated to, according to both survey and interview data.
   Men, however, evaluated the intervention as less personally relevant
   than women, with overall participation of men in the intervention being
   smaller than women. Recommendations for implementing similar
   interventions and future research are offered.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXTENSION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {59},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {This study looks at the role of Extension in helping local officials
   reduce plastic bag use at farmers markets in three Lake County, OH
   communities. We distributed free reusable bags to shoppers and conducted
   an education and outreach program. We then took observations to
   determine if the free reusable bags were being used. We also invited
   shoppers to take a voluntary survey about their environmental attitudes,
   why or why not they use the reusable bags, and how best to reduce
   plastic bag use moving forward. Results from the study suggest that
   supplying free reusable bags at farmer markets is not an effective
   strategy for Extension professionals attempting to reduce plastic bag
   use. Instead, we recommend working with local officials to develop
   financial incentives and disincentives tied to the type of bag option
   shoppers use, implement plastic bag bans at markets, and conduct
   locally-focused education and outreach. Although shoppers' environmental
   literacy and desire for sustainability is high, it is shown that
   behavior change is unlikely to occur without financial or policy
   incentives.},

Abstract = {The waste created by single-use plastics is an important global issue,
   especially in marine environments, because they do not degrade in
   nature. This work aimed to study the biodegradability of bioplastic
   blown film, which may pose a solution to this problem. Polybutylene
   succinate (PBS) and polylactic acid (PLA) blown films were chosen for
   examination of their biodegradability when submerged in sand under the
   seawater and when floated on the seawater surface of our experimental
   setup. Bioplastics were observed in comparison with low-density
   polyethylene (LDPE), which is a petroleum-based plastic. PBS blown film
   exhibited a faster degradation rate than PLA blown film, while LDPE
   blown film did not degrade in the marine environment. The
   biodegradability of bioplastic blown film was confirmed by physical
   observation, a change in the chemical functional group measured by
   Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and a test of the biochemical
   oxygen demand of the seawater after bioplastic degradation due to
   ingestion by bacteria in seawater.},

Abstract = {ABSTRACT: Plastic waste is a growing concern in recent years due to the
   massive increase in single-use plastic applications. Despite the
   ever-increasing amount of waste, recycling plastics is not a simple
   process due to difficulties in sorting, which results in significantly
   downgraded material properties. This handson lab experiment showcases
   the important knowledge steps in a typical recycling process, including
   waste collection, plastic separation and sorting methods, processing
   techniques, and characterization methods including scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) and tensile testing. Additionally, this lab
   demonstrates the importance of miscibility between materials and
   provides evidence that small amounts of block copolymers (BCPs) can
   compatibilize immiscible mixed plastic waste, leading to enhanced
   material properties of recycled products. Through these engaging
   hands-on lessons, students can not only obtain a better understanding
   about the challenge and industrial solution of mixed plastic waste
   recycling, but also realize the importance for protecting environments
   through waste management.},

Title = {An emerging source of plastic pollution: Environmental presence of
   plastic personal protective equipment (PPE) debris related to COVID-19
   in a metropolitan city},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {269},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented surge of
   production, consumption, and disposal of personal protective equipment
   (PPE) including face masks, disposable gloves, and disinfectant wipes,
   which are often made of single use plastic. Widespread public use of
   these items has imposed pressure on municipalities to properly collect
   and dispose of potentially infectious PPE. There has been a lack of
   structured monitoring efforts to quantify the emerging trend of
   improperly disposed of PPE debris. In this study, we present a baseline
   monitoring survey to describe the spatial distribution of PPE debris
   during the COVID-19 pandemic from the metropolitan city of Toronto,
   Canada. Our objectives were to: (1) quantify PPE debris types among
   surveyed areas and; (2) identify PPE debris densities and accumulation
   of surveyed areas. A total of 1306 PPE debris items were documented,
   with the majority being disposable gloves (44\%), followed by face masks
   (31\%), and disinfecting wipes (25\%). Of the face masks, 97\% were
   designed for single use while only 3\% were reusable. Of the surveyed
   locations, the highest daily average densities of PPE debris were
   recorded in the large and medium-sized grocery store parking lots and
   the hospital district (0.00475 items/m(2), 0.00160 items/m(2), and
   0.00133 items/m(2) respectively). The two surveyed residential areas had
   the following highest PPE densities (0.00029 items/m(2) and 0.00027
   items/m(2)), while the recreational trail had the lowest densities
   (0.00020 items/m(2)). Assuming a business-as-usual accumulation, an
   estimated 14,298 PPE items will be leaked as debris in just the surveyed
   areas annually. To facilitate proper disposal of PPE debris by the
   public we recommend development of municipal efforts to improve PPE
   collection methods that are informed by the described PPE waste
   pathways. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Plastic and Us: looking at the marine litter problem from inside the
   rubbish. An unusual temporary exhibition at the Natural History Museum
   of the University of Pisa},
Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {338-356},
Abstract = {In this paper, we will describe a temporary exhibition held at the Museo
   di Storia Naturale dell'Universita di Pisa (Natural History Museum of
   the University of Pisa, hereafter MSN), Italy, in year 2020-2021, and
   the educational and awareness raising results that the proposed approach
   has produced. The aim of this exhibition was to guide the visitor along
   a path of awareness on the very topical issue of ``plastic in our
   environment{''}. It focused not only on the environmental impact
   produced by the dispersal of anthropogenic plastic waste, especially in
   the sea, but also on the awareness of what actions need to be taken,
   both on a governmental and personal level, by each of us, to limit it in
   the future. The exhibition started from the data and images proposed by
   the media, which shocked us with the seriousness of the plastic
   emergency and triggered worldwide attention. Then the emphasis of the
   exhibition shifted to scientific data, rigorously presented by
   researchers who study the issue directly in the field, in the
   Mediterranean Sea and along its coasts. Finally, the last exhibits
   addressed the issue of plastic disposal, inviting visitors to check
   their real knowledge about the concepts of degradable, compostable, or
   recyclable plastic, and to reflect on what could be the most effective
   means to limit plastic problems in the future. The plastic problem is
   exquisitely anthropogenic, and the exhibit was designed to make visitors
   feel involved. The mismanagement of the lifecycle of this material (from
   manufacturing processes to products' end life) can be addressed on a
   global scale by drastically reducing the use and production of
   single-use plastic items, promoting proper waste management, and
   improving the effectiveness of recycling. The exhibition message was
   that laws are essential, as well as calling plastic producers to their
   responsibility, but something can also be done locally by us as
   individuals, through proper disposal and by producing less single-use
   plastic waste. Visitors' attitudes and knowledge on this topic were
   investigated through online questionnaires prepared by experts in the
   field, and the data collected are presented and discussed in this paper.},

Title = {Comparative assessment of marine weathering of ROP-derived biopolymers
   against conventional plastics},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {167},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Bio-based plastics were designed to replace single-use plastics and to
   cause less post-consumer environmental damage. This paper assesses the
   weathering of four bio-based polymers created by ring opening
   polymerization (ROP) promoted by a previously reported Ti-based
   catalyst, to detect any problems before production was scaled up.
   Samples were aged in seawater to identify degradation products and
   monitor structural changes. Surfaces evidenced degradation and a range
   of leaching products was observed. Aside from compounds used in the
   preparation of the plastics (i.e. residual monomers and benzyl alcohol),
   the degradation products included carboxylic acids (often found in
   plastic leachate), oxacyclohexadecan-2-one (potentially toxic to aquatic
   life) and triphenylmethane (potential carcinogen). Overall, there were
   fewer structural changes in the fossil fuel based polymer (PS) and in
   the commercially available bio-based plastic studied for comparison
   purposes than the lab based bio-based polymers.},

Title = {Is conscientious beachcombing the key to `unlock' marine plastic
   pollution trends through citizen science? A case study from Cockburn
   Sound, Western Australia},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {177},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Despite the global implementation of plastic waste reduction policies
   and bans on single use plastics (SuPs), their effectiveness for
   protecting marine ecosystems remains unclear. Frequent monitoring could
   confirm policy effectiveness, but this is difficult due to resourcing
   and logistic constraints. This study tested a `beach litter'
   beachcombing citizen science approach that could overcome some
   constraints. Between November 2018 and January 2021, 168 beach visits
   led to the collection of 12,659 pieces of litter from a beach in Western
   Australia. Litter was predominantly plastic (87\%) and mostly associated
   with fishing/boating (34\%). Significant reductions in six types of
   litter, including fishing/boating items, balloons, and straws were
   detected and four coincided with local government waste mitigation
   measures. We show potential to harness conscientious beachcombers as
   citizen scientists to help evaluate plastic policy impact. Furthermore,
   we propose how to harness this effort and increase spatial and temporal
   coverage of marine plastic pollution monitoring.},

Title = {Effects of information provision on public attitudes toward bioplastics
   in Japan},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {3},
Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {Bioplastics (i.e., bio-based and biodegradable plastics) are attracting
   attention as a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil-based
   plastics. However, their use in Japan, the fifth-highest per capita
   disposal of single-use plastics, has not become as widespread as planned
   by the Japanese government, and an increase in consumer awareness is
   necessary to promote the use of bioplastics and increase the demand for
   sustainable products. In addition, to promote social implementation, it
   is also necessary to understand the difference between bio-based and
   biodegradable plastics and use them correctly. Through an online
   questionnaire survey, this study found that the Japanese public's
   knowledge of bioplastics was low: there was a major difference between
   subjective and objective knowledge, but their perception of bioplastics
   was more positive than that of conventional plastics. However, they had
   little experience in using bioplastics. Therefore, we investigated
   whether providing information would promote the intent to use
   bioplastics. As a result, information provision is likely to be
   effective in increasing the willingness to use bioplastics in addition
   to promoting positive perceptions. The participants indicated a
   significantly greater willingness to pay a higher price for single-use
   plastics (such as a 500 ml bottle of water), but not for durable
   plastics (such as a three-color ballpoint pen).},

   dissolution characteristics},
Journal = {CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {299},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Existing biodegradable plastics may not be ideal replacements of
   petroleum-based single-use plastics owing to their slow biodegradation
   in seawater. To address this issue, a starch-based blend film with
   different disinte-gration/dissolution speeds in freshwater and seawater
   was prepared. Poly(acrylic acid) segments were grafted onto starch; a
   clear and homogenous film was prepared by blending the grafted starch
   with poly(vinyl pyrro-lidone) (PVP) by solution casting. After drying,
   the grafted starch was crosslinked with PVP by hydrogen bonds, owing to
   which the water stability of the film is higher than that of unmodified
   starch films in fresh water. In seawater, the film dissolves quickly as
   a result of disruption of the hydrogen bond crosslinks. This technique
   balances degradability in marine environment and water resistance in
   everyday environment, provides an alternative route to mitigate marine
   plastic pollution and could be potentially useful for single-use
   applications in different fields such as packaging, healthcare, and
   agriculture.},

Abstract = {Environmentally friendly packaging is becoming more popular as the
   number of companies implementing more sustainable solutions continues to
   increase, and consumers become more aware and choose more
   environmentally friendly options. However, not all environmentally
   friendly packaging meets all desirable properties, as some are only
   partially made of renewable raw materials or degrade over a long period
   of time. Bioplastics constructed from blends of gelatine and starch are
   solely made from renewable raw materials. Combined with relatively short
   degradation times, these materials have the potential to replace
   currently used, non-biodegradable film and single-use plastics. However,
   despite these advantages, further research is required to identify the
   best combination of raw materials, selectively and collectively, and to
   then optimise the appropriate physicochemical properties of the
   resultant bioplastics. In this study, gelatine from different sources
   (piscine, porcine, bovine) combined with potato starch was used to
   generate home-compostable bioplastics. These bioplastics were assessed
   in terms of water solubility, water content, opacity, surface roughness,
   and key mechanical properties such as tensile strength. Significant
   differences were found, particularly for piscine gelatine blends. It was
   concluded that piscine gelatine is a promising protein with highly
   relevant properties for the bioplastics industry.},

Title = {Where is my reusable bag? Retailers' bag use before and after the
   plastic bag ban in Dharan Municipality of Nepal},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {120},
Pages = {494-502},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Banning single-use plastic bags is a popular policy intervention among
   cities in developing countries such as Nepal. While the policy marks
   some success in curbing plastic bag usage, it confronts two major
   challenges. First, the effect of the ban often dilutes and becomes
   ineffective over time. Second, bag leakage could occur as customers
   switch to unregulated plastic bags and create more pollutants. Using
   three rounds of retailer-level panel data from the Dharan Municipality
   of Nepal, this study finds evidence to support both contentions. The
   usage of plastic bags slows down initially but rises subsequently as the
   subjective probability of being caught for using banned plastic bags
   reduces with time. One year after the ban, an increase in the expected
   fine does not increase the use of reusable bags but significantly
   reduces that of banned plastic bags. These results show that the ban
   does help reduce the total bag use in the short term but requires
   continued monitoring and enforcement to be effective in the long term.

Abstract = {Purpose Many consumers are transitioning away from single-use plastic
   products and turning to reusable alternatives. Oftentimes, this change
   is being made with the assumption that these alternatives have fewer
   environmental impacts; however, reusable products are frequently made
   from more environmentally intensive materials and have use phase
   impacts. This study used LCA to examine the GWP, water consumption, and
   primary nonrenewable energy use associated with reusable alternatives
   for single-use plastic kitchenware products and determined environmental
   payback periods. Methods The environmental impacts for each reusable
   alternative are calculated on the functional units of 1 use, 1 year (5
   uses/week), and 5 years (5 uses/week). Payback periods are calculated
   for each reusable alternative and defined as the number of times a
   consumer must reuse an alternative in order for the environmental impact
   per use to be equivalent to the environmental impact for the single-use
   product. The research explored the sensitivity of the results to
   different consumer washing and reuse behaviors, as well as local
   conditions such as overall transportation distances and the carbon
   intensity of different electricity grids. Product types studied included
   straws (4 reusable, 2 single-use), sandwich storage (2 reusable, 3
   single-use), coffee cups (3 reusable, 2 single-use), and forks (1
   single-use, 3 reusable). Results and discussion Environmental impacts
   associated with the reusable alternatives were highly dependent on the
   use phase due to dishwashing, making payback period sensitive to washing
   frequency and method, and for GWP, carbon intensity of the energy grid
   (used for water heating). For single-use products, the
   material/manufacturing phase was the largest contributor to overall
   impacts. It was found that nine of the twelve reusable alternatives were
   able to breakeven in all three environmental indicators. The coffee cup
   product type was the only product type to have one reusable alternative,
   the ceramic mug, and have the shortest payback period for all three
   impact categories. Both the bamboo straw and beeswax wrap were unable to
   breakeven in any scenario due to high use phase impacts from manual
   washing. Conclusions The research found that reusable alternatives can
   payback the environmental impacts of GWP, water consumption, and energy
   use associated with their more resource intensive materials, but it is
   dependent on number of uses, consumer behavior, and for GWP, carbon
   intensity of the energy grid. A key takeaway is that consumer behavior
   and use patterns influence the ultimate environmental impact of reusable
   kitchenware products. Recommendations Some recommendations for consumers
   looking to reduce the overall impact of kitchenware products include the
   following: Not always assuming reusable is the best option. Extending
   product lifetime. Researching which reusable option has the lowest
   impact. Following best practice washing behaviors. Not washing products
   after every use. Advocating for integration of renewables into the local
   energy grid. Reducing consumption of these product types (reusable or
   single-use).},

Abstract = {Anxieties about the ills of plastics are not new; concerns about the
   material date as far back as the 1920s. These longstanding concerns did
   not, however, result in a shift in political will toward plastic control
   interventions until recently, with the onset of single-use plastic bans.
   Drawing on data from India, we examine contemporary discourses on
   plastic pollution and plastic control and the ways in which stakeholders
   frame narratives regarding both the ``problem{''} of plastic pollution
   and solutions to this problem. We also highlight three models of
   citizenship-those of the hygienic citizen, the consumer-citizen, and the
   activist citizen-that inform the appeals of stakeholders involved in
   this politics of responsibility. One other stream of discourse, lying
   outside these models, focuses on yet-to-be-implemented scientific and
   technological innovations that can address plastic pollution. This
   stream has the potential to create a false impression of progress toward
   plastic control in the public imaginary and to absolve citizens of
   responsibility for the plastic problem.},

   host high local inhabitants, growing tourist footfall in the IHR
   increases solid wastes significantly. The lack of appropriate SWM
   facilities has posed a serious threat to the mountain-dwelling
   communities. SWM is challenging in the highlands due to the remoteness,
   topographical configuration, increasing urbanization, and harsh climate
   compared to plain areas. Difficulty in managing SWM has led to improper
   disposal methods, like open dumping and open burning of waste, that are
   adversely affecting the fragile IHR ecosystem. Open dumping of
   unsegregated waste pollutes the freshwater streams, and burning releases
   major pollutants often linked to the glacier melt. Processes like
   composting, vermicomposting, and anaerobic digestion to treat
   biodegradable wastes are inefficient due to the regions' extreme cold
   conditions. IHR specific SWM rules were revised in 2016 to deal with the
   rising problem of SWM, providing detailed criteria for setting up solid
   waste treatment facilities and promoting waste-to-energy (WtE). Despite
   governments' effort to revise SWM; measures like proper collection,
   segregation, treatment, and solid waste disposal needs more attention in
   the IHR. Door-to-door collection, segregation at source, covered
   transportation, proper treatment, and disposal are the primary steps to
   resource recovery across the IHR. Approaches such as waste recycling,
   composting, anaerobic digestion, refuse-derived fuel (RDF), and gas
   recovery from landfills are essential for waste alteration into valuable
   products initiatives like `ban on single-use plastic' and `polluters to
   pay' have a potential role in proper SWM in the IHR. Research and
   technology, capacity building, mass awareness programs, and initiatives
   like `ban on single-use plastic' and `polluters to pay' have a potential
   role in proper SWM in the IHR. This review highlights the current status
   of waste generation, the current SWM practices, and SWM challenges in
   the IHR. The review also discusses the possible resource recovery from
   waste in the IHR, corrective measures introduced by the government
   specific to IHR and, the way forward for improved SWM for achieving
   sustainable development of the IHR.},

Abstract = {With respect to the explosion of single-use plastic packaging
   consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic, environmentally friendly
   substitutes are critically needful for sustainable development.
   Therefore, the present work focuses on the functional properties of
   bioplastic blends prepared through hot compressing molding of
   thermoplastic starch (TPS) and spent coffee grounds (SCG) in different
   ratios (0\%-20\% SCG) as the potential features of SCG were extensively
   employed in biocomposites for the first time. The insertion of dark
   brown SCG into TPS hindered UV transmission by 100\% at 320 nm and
   99.2\% at 400 nm. Moreover, the samples with 15\% and 20\% SCG induced a
   surge in radical scavenging activity from 7.95\% to over 92\% at a
   concentration of 0.1 g/ml owing to the rich source of antioxidants in
   SCG. The lignin component and high carbon content also improved the
   thermal performance of TPS/SCG blends, enhancing thermal stability,
   delaying onset and maximum degradation temperatures, and achieving the
   HB rating in the UL-94 test. Compared to a pure TPS matrix, TPS blends
   incorporating up to 10\% SCG exhibited improvement in elastic modulus
   without deterioration of tensile strength.},

Abstract = {The abyss (3500?6500 m) covers the bulk of the deep ocean floor yet
   little is known about the extent of plastic debris on the abyssal
   seafloor. Using video imagery we undertook a quantitative assessment of
   the debris present on the abyssal seafloor (5700?5800 m depth) beneath
   the Kuroshio Extension current system in the Northwest Pacific. This
   body of water is one of the major transit pathways for the massive
   amounts of debris that are entering the North Pacific Ocean from Asia.
   Shallower sites (1400?1500 m depth) were also investigated for
   comparison. The dominant type of debris was single-use plastics - mainly
   bags and food packaging. The density of the plastic debris (mean 4561
   items/km2) in the abyssal zone was the highest recorded for an abyssal
   plain suggesting that the deep-sea basin in the Northwest Pacific is a
   significant reservoir of plastic debris.},

Abstract = {Plastics are the most advanced materials, regarding their application
   and property range, with an annual worldwide demand of over 400 million
   tonnes, but have been facing strong public opposition lately.
   In the debate on sustainable plastics, plastic waste and plastic
   littering, bio-based and especially biodegradable plastics have gained
   attention as potential solution to these problems. This has been
   accompanied by misunderstanding, false and inadequate labeling of
   plastics as well as insufficient communication with the public and
   authorities. The plastic waste and littering problems are addressed by
   already implemented and planned bans on single-use plastics, improved
   regulations for labeling and communication of biodegradable plastics,
   and enhancement of plastic recycling. The future will show how
   successful these strategies are. If plastics are produced with renewable
   carbon from biomass, direct CO2 utilization and recycling, the
   production can be completely independent from fossil resources in a
   long-term future perspective which supports the circular renewable
   carbon economy.},

   Playing catch- up},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {774},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {The early 2000's encompassed a rising awareness by the scientific
   community, the general public and policy makers of the impending
   environmental catastrophe caused by the increasing prevalence of
   plastics in the environment. Soon thereafter, a slew of regulatory
   initiatives and policies and actions targeting plastic pollution were
   put forth by governments, international institutions, non-governmental
   organizations, companies and even by citizen groups. However, the 2020
   COVID19 pandemic has disrupted this momentum, and, presently, many fear
   that plastic pollution will increase, not only due to the increased
   consumption of single-use plastic items, but also due to the ever
   growing need of personal protective equipment. Many plastic pollution
   reduction policies have been suspended, cancelled or postponed. Herein,
   some of these delayed policies and initiatives are overviewed and, based
   on publicly available data, the questions as to whether, at a global
   level, increased government action to address plastic pollution will
   continue, or will the pandemic change this paradigm, are tentatively
   answered, as well as whether the pandemic will affect plastic
   production, in particular, single-use plastics, and what the potential
   routes to overcome these tendencies maybe. As such, the dynamics of the
   interaction between the restrictive measures adopted in the wake of this
   pandemic and plastic pollution are examined, as are the roles of
   different legislative and regulatory bodies, whether at the local,
   regional or international levels. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Joining Sustainable Design and Internet of Things Technologies on
   Campus: The IPVC Smartbottle Practical Case},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Higher education institutions (HEIs) are favored environments for the
   implementation of technological solutions that accelerate the generation
   of smart campi, given the dynamic ecosystem they create based on the
   involvement of inspired and motivated human resources (students,
   professors, and researchers), moving around in an atmosphere of advanced
   digital infrastructures and services. Moreover, HEIs have, in their
   mission, not only the creation of integrated knowledge through Research
   and Development (R\&D) activities but also solving societal problems
   that address the academic community expectations concerning
   environmental issues, contributing, therefore, towards a greener society
   embodied within the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals
   (SDGs). This article addresses the design and implementation of a
   Smartbottle Ecosystem in which an interactive and reusable water bottle
   communicates with an intelligent water refill station, both integrated
   by the Internet of Things (IoT) and Information and Communications
   Technologies (ICT), to eliminate the use of single-use plastic water
   bottles in the premises of the Polytechnical Institute of Viana do
   Castelo (IPVC), an HEI with nearly 6000 students. Three main
   contributions were identified in this research: (i) the proposal of a
   novel methodology based on the association of Design Thinking and
   Participatory Design as the basis for Sustainable Design; (ii) the
   design and development of an IoT-enabled smartbottle prototype; and
   (iii) the usability evaluation of the proposed prototype. The adopted
   methodology is rooted in Design Thinking and mixes it with a
   Participatory Design approach, including the end-user opinion throughout
   the Smartbottle Ecosystem design process, not only for the product
   design requirements but also for its specification. By promoting a
   participatory solution tailored to the IPVC academic community, recycled
   plastic has been identified as the preferential material and a marine
   mammal was selected for the smartbottle shape, in the process of
   developing a solution to replace the single-use plastic bottles.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine campaign narratives in four
   short documentary series entitled ``Plastic Island.{''} Segara Kertih,
   Karmaphala, Bedawang Nala, and Tri Hita Karana are the titles of these
   four documentary programs. The short video series was created to raise
   community awareness of single-use plastic risks and modify social
   behavior via the use of Balinese culture and local wisdom. The research
   used a narrative analysis approach with Walter Fisher's narrative
   paradigm and Boaventura De Saosa Santos's Epistemologies of the South.
   The stories from Plastic Island demonstrate how local wisdom may be
   transformed into alternative knowledge to achieve global social
   liberation. The study results reveal that the four short documentary
   series have narrative probability, coherence, and narrative fidelity in
   the context of native Balinese wisdom values. Religious symbols and
   cultural ideas are reflected in the environmental communication
   campaign, which is based on the initiative Plastic Island. Returning to
   local wisdom is a natural conservation strategy based on shared
   knowledge, community values, and ancestral history.},

Abstract = {Ocean plastic waste is an urgent environmental crisis, subject to
   growing media and policy scrutiny. We use Q-methodology to assess
   stakeholder perspectives on management practices, finding four emergent
   discourses concerning: environmental citizenship, global policy
   responsibility, health prioritization and economic incentivisation. We
   find stakeholder consensus on the impacts, levels of media coverage and
   need for action - creating a `policy window' for strong environmental
   governance. Yet there remains disparity over who should lead
   pro-environmental action, and whether consumer behavior will genuinely
   change over time. Visual communication emerges as a popular tool to
   build social capacity for change. It behoves policymakers to learn from
   other visual behavior change initiatives, such as those on cigarette
   packaging, to stimulate long-term public engagement. By combining visual
   communication with taxes and levies to alter demand-side management for
   single use plastic products, we suggest that longer-term sustainable
   behavior change can be achieved.},

Title = {Plastic waste to fuels by hydrocracking at mild conditions},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2021},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Single-use plastics impose an enormous environmental threat, but their
   recycling, especially of polyolefins, has been proven challenging. We
   report a direct method to selectively convert polyolefins to branched,
   liquid fuels including diesel, jet, and gasoline-range hydrocarbons,
   with high yield up to 85\% over Pt/WO3/ZrO2 and HY zeolite in hydrogen
   at temperatures as low as 225 degrees C. The process proceeds via tandem
   catalysis with initial activation of the polymer primarily over Pt, with
   subsequent cracking over the acid sites of WO3/ZrO2 and HY zeolite,
   isomerization over WO3/ZrO2 sites, and hydrogenation of olefin
   intermediates over Pt. The process can be tuned to convert different
   common plastic wastes, including low- and high-density polyethylene,
   polypropylene, polystyrene, everyday polyethylene bottles and bags, and
   composite plastics to desirable fuels and light lubricants.},

Abstract = {When excerpts from documentaries about plastic waste are shared on
   social media, they can increase problem awareness among millions of
   users. However, they can also inadvertently discourage plastic avoidance
   by emphasising the scale of the problem and undesirable social norms. An
   online experiment was undertaken with 1,001 respondents to test if
   exposure to social media friendly video clips from documentaries about
   plastic waste influenced plastic avoidance perceptions and behaviours.
   While social norm perceptions differed depending on how the issue was
   presented and who delivered the message, the clips were most effective
   in sensitising the market by promoting the benefits of avoidance,
   increasing policy support, and increasing willingness to communicate
   about the issue. The theoretical and practical implications are
   discussed.},

Title = {Scattered accumulation hotspots of macro-litter on the seafloor:
   Insights for mitigation actions},

Abstract = {Marine litter is an ever-increasing problem that demands immediate
   reduction plans and mitigation actions that should act synergically to
   efficiently meet ambitious goals. Since the seafloor has been recognized
   as the major sink for marine debris, the study of litter accumulation
   dynamics represent a fundamental tool to evaluate possible removal
   actions. We analysed a 7 years (2013-2019) standardized data series
   collected along Sardinian fishing grounds through MEDiterranean
   International Trawl Survey, for which estimates of density and weight of
   seafloor macro-litter were calculated for over 707 hauls. Results show
   the absence of any temporal trend in seafloor macro-litter density and
   weight, but rather indicate a spatial and bathymetric segregation of
   different litter categories. Our data showed how different sources and
   physical features of macro-litter items (i.e., plastic and fishing gear,
   rubber, glass, metals, and cloth) led to spatially segregated
   accumulation hotspots. We also point out here how the identification of
   seafloor macro-litter hotspots using aggregated data that include
   plastic items could obscure the identification of other segregated but
   yet relevant hotspots of other macro-litter categories accumulated in
   the marine environment. These hotspots often occurred at shallower
   depths and closer to coastlines, thus representing potential spots where
   eventual future litter removal action could be prioritized.},

Abstract = {The large quantities of non-degradable single use plastics, production
   and disposal, in addition to increasing amounts of municipal and
   industrial wastewaters are among the major global issues known today.
   Biodegradable plastics from biopolymers such as
   Poly-beta-hydroxybutyrates (PHB) produced by microorganisms are
   potential substitutes for non-degradable petroleum-based plastics. This
   paper reviews the current status of wastewater-cultivated microbes
   utilized in PHB production, including the various types of wastewaters
   suitable for either pure or mixed culture PHB production. PHB-producing
   strains that have the potential for commercialization are also
   highlighted with proposed selection criteria for choosing the
   appropriate PHB microbe for optimization of processes. The biosynthetic
   pathways involved in producing microbial PHB are also discussed to
   highlight the advancements in genetic engineering techniques.
   Additionally, the paper outlines the factors influencing PHB production
   while exploring other metabolic pathways and metabolites simultaneously
   produced along with PHB in a bio-refinery context. Furthermore, the
   paper explores the effects of extraction methods on PHB yield and
   quality to ultimately facilitate the commercial production of
   biodegradable plastics. This review uniquely discusses the developments
   in research on microbial biopolymers, specifically PHB and also gives an
   overview of current commercial PHB companies making strides in cutting
   down plastic pollution and greenhouse gases. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Consumers' sustainability-related perception of and willingness-to-pay
   for food packaging alternatives},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {181},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Research regarding consumers' perception of and willingness-to-pay for
   alternatives to conventional plastic packaging reveals an ambiguous
   picture. On one hand, consumers are said to be neither willing to change
   their consumption behavior nor to pay for alternatives. On the other
   hand, there is evidence that consumers have an increasing environmental
   awareness and a positive willingness-to-pay for packaging alternatives.
   The mixed-method study (Discrete Choice Experiment and qualitative
   free-text analysis) described in this paper, elucidates the role of
   consumers and analyzes both consumers' sustainability-related perception
   of and willingness-to-pay for alternative food packaging (unpackaged,
   paper, recycling plastic, bioplastic). Results demonstrate that
   consumers are willing to pay for packaging that they perceive to be
   sustainable and are not willing to pay for packaging that they perceive
   to be non-sustainable or about which they are uncertain. Considering the
   general disagreement on what kind of packaging actually is sustainable,
   these results raise the question: if neither theorists, nor companies,
   nor government agree on the sustainability of different types of
   packaging - how are consumers supposed to make correct assessments?
   Besides, results demonstrate that consumers are largely united in their
   general dissatisfaction with the current packaging situation, even
   though they are aware of the positive characteristics of single-use
   plastic packaging.},

Title = {Temporal changes of plastic litter and associated encrusting biota:
   Evidence from Central Italy (Mediterranean Sea)},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {181},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We investigated the temporal changes from spring to summer of the
   stranded litter and the composition of plastic encrusting biota along an
   Italian beach. Our findings highlight a higher quantity of litter
   (average value 1510.67 +/- 581.27 items) in spring, particularly plastic
   material with a composition driven by currents, winds and waves
   transported from rivers to sea. During summer the source was caused by
   anti-social behaviours (e.g. cigarettes). Regarding the plastic size,
   the most is macroplastic (85.96 \%), followed by mesoplastic (13.74 \%)
   and mega plastic (0.30 \%) overall, and no seasonal trend was observed.
   Concerning the encrusting biota, Mollusca was the most frequent phylum
   found on plastic beach litter, whereas Porifera the most abundant
   overall. During spring a greater abundance of individuals was recorded
   compared to summer. The trend of taxa richness was decreasing from
   spring to summer. Arthropoda, Porifera and Mollusca phyla were
   significantly more abundant in spring, while Algae in summer.},

Abstract = {Purpose Plastics generate more than 500 tons of waste in Ecuador each
   year, according to statistics from 2016. Therefore, the Ecuadorian
   Congress has approved a law to ban single-use plastics to deal with
   their high volumes contaminating the environment. Furthermore,
   researchers and policymakers have been concerned about finding possible
   solutions to replace single-use plastics. Hence, the production of
   polylactic acid (PLA) in Ecuador and its environmental impact analysis
   and potential use as the replacement material for petroleum-based
   polymers is the aim of this study. Methods An environmental performance
   analysis is carried out for the potential production of polylactic acid
   (PLA) in Guayaquil, Ecuador. For this purpose, the life cycle assessment
   (LCA) methodology has been used. Therefore, the LCA was considered in
   three steps: production of PLA, transformation to film product, and
   end-of-life scenario. The LCA was performed to analyze the potential
   environmental impact of 1 m(2) PLA film production. The International
   Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) 2011 Midpoint + method, which exists in
   SimaPro software, was used for the impact analysis. Results and
   discussion The production of biodegradable PLA film causes a climate
   change impact of 0.85 kg CO2 eq for the established functional unit and
   several positive environmental impacts. Due to the natural raw material
   used for its production, the PLA production process significantly
   contributes to the impacts. The process contribution order was
   calculated starting with PLA production (74.32\%), then electricity
   (20.41\%), polyethylene glycol (PEG) (5.05\%), and finally transport
   (0.21\%). An increase in PLA production requires more land, machinery,
   fuel, and fertilizers. These increases mean higher environmental
   impacts. PLA production in Ecuador showed a 14\% higher climate change
   indicator than its production in the USA. Optimization of the process
   could lower the indicator. The landfill scenario was the most pollutant,
   but recycling shows great promise as the option for end-of-life.
   Conclusion Despite being a bio-solution, all the parameters must be
   considered when analyzing a shift from plastics to PLA biopolymer.
   According to the sensitivity analysis, the production of PLA and its
   film product system had a good consistency when parameters like the
   amount of sugar needed is varied. According to the environmental score
   obtained, PLA production from sugar cane is the best option in its
   production in Ecuador.},

Abstract = {Current test methods for estimating biodegradability and duration in the
   oceans, do not consider nitrogen as a limiting factor for bacterial
   growth and plastic biodegradation. Algae and cyanobacteria can thrive
   within widely ranging Nitrogen/Phosphorous ratios from 5:1 to 100:1 The
   ocean's biodiversity that we know could die off if algae and
   cyanobacteria out compete existing dominant bacteria. Normally organic
   loading would be localized, but the slow degradation of microplastics
   allows the circulation across all the oceans. Single use plastics, such
   as wipes are having an increasing impact due to significant growth of
   demand and particularly with sanitation concerns with COVID-19.
   Biodegradability of plastics needs to be reassessed and the use of
   actual ocean conditions is needed. Verifying claims of biodegradability
   need to be reassessed since these are based on methods that have not
   considered nitrogen limitations in the ocean.},

   Confinement: An Alternative Method of Managing Plastic Waste from the

Journal = {ENGINEERING JOURNAL-THAILAND},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Plastic pollution is one of the most significant environmental issues
   worldwide. During Covid-19 pandemic, single-use plastic containers have
   been overused due to a lock-down policy. This led to remarkable increase
   in municipal plastic wastes. An alternative method to manipulate plastic
   wastes is to recycle them as construction and building materials. The
   research introduces an idea of using plastic straw to produce
   fibre-reinforced polymer composite as a strengthening material to
   confine concrete. The plastic straw fibre-reinforced polymer composite
   coupons were tested to obtain their tensile strength, ultimate strain,
   and elastic modulus. A series of compression tests were conducted on
   plastic straw fibre-reinforced polymer composite confined concrete to
   investigate the improved strength and ductility performance. The results
   show that the mechanical properties of plastic straw fibre-reinforced
   polymer composite are acceptable for concrete strengthening purpose.
   More importantly, use of plastic straw fibre-reinforced polymer
   composite is rewarded by its environmental solution for reduction of
   plastic wastes in household.},

Title = {Assessment of Biodegradation and Eco-Toxic Properties of Novel Starch
   and Gelatine Blend Bioplastics},
Journal = {RECYCLING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {To combat the release of petroleum-derived plastics into the environment
   the European Commission has adopted the EU plastics strategy, which aims
   for a complete ban on single-use plastics by 2030. Environmentally
   friendly and sustainable packaging like bioplastic is being up taken at
   significant levels by companies and consumers. In this study, the
   environmental impact of novel gelatine-starch blend bioplastics is
   investigated. The assessments included ecotoxicology with different
   species that can be found in marine and soil environments to simulate
   natural conditions. Microalgae, plant, and nematode species were chosen
   as these are representative of their habitats and are known for their
   sensitivity to pollutants. Degradation rates of these novel bioplastics
   were assessed as well as microbiome analysis of the soil before and
   after bioplastic degradation. The main findings of this study are that
   (i) the bioplastic generated can be fully biodegraded in soil
   environments at moderate conditions (20 degrees C) leaving no physical
   traces; (ii) bioplastic did not exhibit significantly adverse effects on
   any organisms assessed in this study; (iii) microbiome analysis of the
   soil after biodegradation showed a decrease in alpha diversity and a
   significant increase of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes phyla, which were
   dominative in the soil.},

Abstract = {Twenty beaches located around the island of Cyprus, in the eastern
   Mediterranean, were identified as monitoring sites. They were monitored
   over four monitoring sessions from January to September 2021 to assess
   marine litter amounts, categories, and spatiotemporal distribution. A
   total of 42,499 marine litter items were collected. The average marine
   litter density was 0.19 items/m(2). Most of the collected items were
   plastics, with single-use plastics being ubiquitous. Plastic fragments
   >2.5 cm made a significant proportion of the plastic litter collected,
   particularly in the northern coasts of the island. Cigarette butts were
   abundant on touristic beaches, especially in the tourism period. The
   study identifies significant temporal and spatial variations in the
   abundance and distribution of marine litter, as well as variations
   related to waste management or lack thereof.},

Abstract = {Single use plastics pose environmental and socioeconomic problems in our
   life and ecosystems. After a 14 year attempt, Kenya successfully adopted
   a plastic bag ban for secondary packaging in August 2017. Globally, the
   impact of plastic bag policies are limited or not documented. Using a
   questionnaire survey, this study explored consumer consciousness towards
   the ban, reusable bag usage behavior, and estimated plastic bag
   consumption before the ban. Results indicate that the ban has favorable
   support of about 67\% from consumers. The perceptions towards
   cleanliness and waste management were different between urban and rural
   respondents. This highlighted differences in awareness creation and
   enforcement of the ban. Behaviorally, ownership of reusable bags tripled
   to 12 bags per household. Plastic reusable bags were the most owned and
   most discarded bags within 6 months. Moreover, a report estimates that
   300 million bags (8.3-6.7 bags person(-1) y(-1)) were consumed annually
   in 2005 and 2017 before the ban, the current study estimates the ban
   potential eliminates about 6.2 billion bags (138 bags capita(-1) y(-1))
   from the waste stream. It is thus important to incorporate usage
   frequency, reusable bags standards, waste and health factors in policy
   formulation. Proper usage of reusable bags prevents waste and lowers
   their environmental burden.},

Title = {Standardized method for controlled modification of poly (ethylene
   terephthalate) (PET) crystallinity for assaying PET degrading enzymes},
Journal = {METHODSX},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Abstract = {Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is a polyester plastic, which is
   widely used, notably as a material for single-use plastic bottles. Its
   accumulation in the environment now poses a global pollution threat. A
   number of enzymes are active on PET providing new options for industrial
   biorecycling of PET materials. The enzyme activity is strongly affected
   by the degree of PET crystallinity (XC), and the XC is therefore a
   relevant factor to consider in enzyme catalyzed PET recycling. Here, we
   present a new experimental methodology, based on systematic thermal
   annealing for controlled preparation of PET disks having different XC,
   to allow systematic quantitative evaluation of the efficiency of PET
   degrading enzymes at different degrees of PET substrate crystallinity.
   We discuss the theory of PET crystallinity and compare PET crystallinity
   data measured by differential scanning calorimetry and attenuated
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This study introduces a simple
   method for controlling the crystallinity of PET samples via annealing in
   a heat block. The present methodology is not limited to the analytical
   methods included in the methods details. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

Abstract = {The widespread use and irresponsible disposal of single-use plastic
   shopping bags are posing a significant threat to environmental
   sustainability. The use of non-plastic reusable shopping bags (NPRSBs)
   is being promoted in several jurisdictions to avert this challenge.
   However, this form of pro-environmental behaviour is failing to embed
   among consumers in emerging markets. This study therefore examines the
   factors influencing the behaviour of using NPRSBs among consumers, using
   a modified theory of planned behaviour. Data were collected from 487
   South African consumers using a structured questionnaire and were
   analysed using structural equation modelling. The results identified
   `attitudes' and `personal norms' as the building blocks for the
   formation of pro-reusable shopping bags use intentions, which, in turn,
   influence actual behaviour. The findings also pointed to the need to
   foster the development of descriptive norms related to the use of NPRSBs
   in order to enhance mainstream use. Accordingly, this study recommends
   the use of rational and norm-based strategies to stimulate the behaviour
   of using NPRSBs.},

Abstract = {Plastic litter in places like Tanzania comes from the unregulated
   production of single-use plastic products and the legal and illegal
   dumps located at riverbanks or near the coast (Nipe Fagio, 2021). This
   pollution is dangerous to human health as well as to the species in the
   ocean. Oceans are fundamental in controlling the earth's climate. If the
   ocean is polluted, an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and
   acidification in the ocean will accelerate, which will result in
   sea-level rise causing disastrous consequences (Lukambuzi, 2006).
   This calls for a sound environmental response to the pandemic in
   connection with research on ocean science. Formulating our laws and
   policies in response to this is vital, and therefore, institutions need
   capacity building to work on the matter at hand. Government officers,
   law, and policymakers need to be reminded, trained, and sensitized on
   the importance of formulating good laws and policies that protect our
   ocean from pollution. These are key players in the immediate and
   long-term recovery efforts from the environmental impact of COVID-19
   because they have the power to enact laws and oversee government
   policies.},

Title = {An overview of plastic straw policies in the Americas},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {172},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Although plastic straws account for a small fraction of urban residue,
   they are also found in marine and coastal waste, raising concerns in the
   community and resulting in policies to curb or ban improper disposal.
   These policies are still little documented and discussed in the
   scientific literature. This review article aims at surveying,
   categorizing and analyzing existing regulations on the American
   continent (North, Central and South America and the Caribbean). The
   regulations were analyzed in terms of straw bans; obligations regarding
   the type of raw material used in manufacturing; accessibility-related
   exceptions to bans; and the adoption of environmental education
   measures. A total of 363 regulations enacted in 62.8\% of American
   countries were examined, 37\% of which need technical standards to
   support their requirements. In Central America and the Caribbean, it is
   primarily the regulations that provide environmental education.
   Locations with a strong beach tourism economy have enacted plastic straw
   regulations.},

Abstract = {A complete understanding of the occurrence of microplastics and the
   methods to eliminate their sources is an urgent necessity to minimize
   the pollution caused by microplastics. The use of plastics in any form
   releases microplastics to the environment. Existing policy instruments
   are insufficient to address microplastics pollution and regulatory
   measures have focussed only on the microbeads and single-use plastics.
   Fees on the use of plastic products may possibly reduce their usage, but
   effective management of plastic products at their end-of-life is
   lacking. Therefore, in this study, the microplastic-failure mode and
   effect analysis (MP-FMEA) methodology, which is a semi-qualitative
   approach capable of identifying the causes and proposing solutions for
   the issue of microplastics pollution, has been proposed. The innovative
   feature of MP-FMEA is that it has a pre-defined failure mode, that is,
   the release of microplastics to air, water and soil (depending on the
   process) or the occurrence of microplastics in the final product.
   Moreover, a theoretical recycling plant case study was used to
   demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of this method. The results
   revealed that MP-FMEA is an easy and heuristic technique to understand
   the failure-effect-causes and solutions for reduction of microplastics
   and can be applied by researchers working in different domains apart
   from those relating to microplastics. Future studies can include the
   evaluation of the use of MP-FMEA methodology along with quantitative
   methods for effective reduction in the release of microplastics.},

Abstract = {The anthropogenic marine debris in the Mediterranean Sea represents a
   growing concern because of its potentially harmful impact on marine
   ecosystems. In this paper, we investigated the composition of marine
   debris in the Iskenderun Bay seafloor. Between November 2009 and April
   2010, a total of 34 trawl operations were conducted. Hauls lasted 60-385
   min, and the towing speed varied between 2.7 and 2.8 knots. The
   estimated average marine litter concentration was 450.94 item/km2 (90.34
   kg/km2). Plastic was the dominant material type (87\%) at all stations.
   Single-use plastic items represented about 74.9\% of the total marine
   litter. Our results showed that there is severe plastic pollution on the
   seafloor of Iskenderun Bay that may cause significant damage to both the
   fisheries sector and the marine environment.},

Abstract = {Plastic is one of the most commonly found residues in the marine
   environment, which can cause several impacts. This study evaluated the
   interaction of marine litter with surf-zone trammel nets in Southern
   Brazil. Fifty fishing operations were sampled, where 4213 items were
   captured: 1500 discarded fish, 1384 fragments of marine litter, and 1329
   utilized fishes. Plastics were the most abundant items (n = 1363),
   representing 98.4\% of the registered marine litter, especially plastic
   bags (n = 1191). 94.5\% of registered marine litter is considered as
   single-use waste. The interaction with marine litter can cause negative
   impacts to small-scale fisheries (e.g. economic and damage to fishing
   nets). We highlight the urgency in implementing actions for urban solid
   waste management and public policies to reduce single-use plastics and
   educational campaigns on the environmental theme.},

Title = {Improvement of Packaging Circularity through the Application of Reusable
   Beverage Cup Reuse Models at Outdoor Festivals and Events},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Festivals generate huge amounts of waste during a short period of time,
   usually in three to four days. Single-use packaging is one of the
   dominant waste streams at the festivals. In order to minimize single-use
   plastic packaging waste generation and negative impacts on the
   environment, outdoor festivals apply alternative reusable cup systems
   and strategies. However, little studies have been made on how different
   reusable beverage cup reuse models can affect material circularity
   within certain festivals, and how it contributes to cup damage and loss.
   This article presents the results of a pilot study of different reusable
   cup reuse models within seven Lithuanian summer outdoor festivals. Three
   different models were applied and tested: A-only reusable cups,
   non-refundable model; B-only reusable cups, with deposit-refund; C-a
   mixed system of reusable cups with deposit-refund and of single-use
   cups. Material flow analysis (MFA) was performed, and the Materials
   Circularity Indicator (MCI), developed by Ellen MacArthur Foundation,
   was calculated to study the applied models. According to the findings,
   refund models (B, C models) have lower rates of damaged and lost cups
   compared to non-refundable reusable cup reuse model (A model). This
   paper shows that different reuse models provide different damage, loss
   and return rates of reusable cups. The data presented can aid
   decision-makers who need to choose a reuse model for a certain event.},

Abstract = {Limited success has been reported thus far on the effectiveness of
   government interventions such tax in promoting the use of green shopping
   bags in South Africa's grocery retail sector. This study represents an
   initial effort in an emerging market to understand the influence of
   value orientations in promoting the use of green shopping bags. This
   study employs the value-belief-norm theory to examine whether personal
   values influence the use of green shopping bags in South Africa.
   Self-reported data was collected from a convenient sample of 487
   consumers using a questionnaire survey. Structural equation modelling
   results identified biospheric value as the major predictor of new
   ecological paradigm. The relationship between altruistic value and new
   ecological paradigm was found to be insignificant. Awareness of
   consequences was found to have a positive significant influence on
   ascription of responsibility. Furthermore, personal norm managed to
   explain a significant variance in the behaviour of using green shopping
   bags. The findings of this study support the use of personal value
   orientations in formulating policies aimed at promoting the use of green
   shopping bags.},

Title = {Ecotoxicological and physiological risks of microplastics on fish and
   their possible mitigation measures},

Abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) are widely distributed and extensively found within
   marine ecosystems, and approximately 8 million tons of plastics are
   being dumped into the sea annually. Once reached the marine environment,
   plastics tend to get fragmented into smaller particles through
   photo-degradation, mechanical and biological processes. These MPs have
   raised concerns globally due to their potential toxic impacts on a wide
   variety of aquatic fauna and humans. Ingested microplastics can cause
   severe health implications in fishes, including reduced feeding
   intensity, improper gill functioning, immuno-suppression, and
   compromised reproducibility. Several studies were also conducted to
   scrutinize MPs trophic transfer through the food chain from primary
   producers to top predators and their bioaccumulation. This paper briefly
   summarizes all the possible sources, routes, bioavailability, trophic
   transfer, and consequences of microplastics in fishes. The review
   article also intended to highlight various mitigation strategies like
   implementing Four R's concept (refuse, reduce, reuse, and recycle),
   integrated strategies, ban on single-use plastics, use bioplastics, and
   create behavioural changes with public awareness.

Abstract = {The rise in the use of single-use plastics and personal protective
   equipment (PPE) has increased plastic waste in the marine environment.
   In this study, we surveyed the presence of PPE (face masks and gloves)
   discharged in 6 beaches along the coast of India. A total of 496 PPE
   were counted with an average density of 1.08 x 10(-3) PPE m(-2). The PPE
   density found was comparable to previous studies. Face masks were the
   most recorded type of PPE (98.39\%), with gloves accounting for only
   1.61\% of the total. However, a significant reduction in the appearance
   of PPE was recorded on all six beaches, likely due to the increase in
   vaccination rates. The most contaminated places were the beaches with
   recreational activities + fishing. It has been noticed that the lack of
   awareness of environmental pollution and the negligence of the
   population and the mismanagement of municipal waste are the main causes
   of beach pollution by PPE. This study confirms the potential threat of
   PPE to terrestrial and aquatic organisms of multiple taxa in India, but
   further studies are needed to quantify the impact of this type of waste
   on marine animals.},

Abstract = {The increasing global concern surrounding plastic marine pollution has
   placed a spotlight on the key items identified as major contributors.
   The subsequent public outcry has forced key value-chain actors - such as
   brand owners, retailers and restaurateurs - to be seen to be responding
   to the issue. However, are their responses motivated by a true desire
   for environmentalism or are actors engaging in greenwashing? In this
   case study on plastic straws, the brand owners and retailers interviewed
   are driven by a desire to meet consumer expectations. This desire has
   led to the substitution of plastic straws with glass, paper and
   polylactide alternatives. However, the broader environmental
   implications of the alternatives are rarely considered. This
   single-minded focus on marine pollution has the potential to result in
   inadvertent greenwashing as alternative products may result in more harm
   in other environmental compartments.
   Significance:
   The increasing concern surrounding plastic pollution has placed a
   spotlight on key items, forcing plastic value-chain actors to respond.
   The broader environmental impacts of the interventions are rarely
   considered, resulting in the potential for adoption of products which
   may result in increased harm in other environmental compartments.},

Abstract = {In this article we show that it is possible to reduce carrier bags
   consumption without imposing additional costs on supermarket customers.
   To this end, we exploit the fact that people shopping in a certain area
   are likely to have homogeneous preferences on certain dimensions (e.g.,
   sport teams). We implement a simple treatment in a supermarket in
   Naples, Italy: whenever a customer of the supermarket buys a single-use
   carrier bag we donate a small sum to an institution that is likely to be
   perceived negatively by the customers of the supermarket (an
   ``anti-charity{''}). Vice versa, whenever a customer does not purchase a
   bag, we donate the same amount to an association that is likely to be
   perceived positively by the customers of the supermarket (a
   ``charity{''}). We measure the impact of the treatment with respect to
   the previous weeks, the corresponding weeks of the previous year and we
   look at the persistence of the effect. Our results show that this
   treatment causes a significant reduction in bags consumption without
   imposing monetary costs on supermarket customers. Moreover, we show that
   our nudge can easily be used by regulators at virtually no cost by
   creating multi-city tournaments. We explain how these tournaments could
   be arranged. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Vietnam's most popular island, Phu Quoc, is undergoing rapid
   social-ecological change. Two crucial drivers of this are tourism
   development and plastic-intensive everyday practices. The growing amount
   of wasted single-use plastics is increasingly shaping the appearance of
   places on the island and challenging the creation of tourist imaginaries
   of a pristine tropical landscape. Very few qualitative empirical studies
   have analysed the place-making quality of waste in tourism settings,
   along with everyday waste management practices and their social-spatial
   implications. The paper draws on Goffman's theatre metaphor of front-
   and backstage places to explore waste-tourism relations as an ongoing
   place-making practice aimed at creating the image tourists are seeking.
   We scrutinise the place-making efforts of both the international tourism
   industry and local authorities. Our empirical findings reveal that the
   frontstage paradise makes backstage places necessary to accumulate or
   store discarded items. As our research shows, this has led to increasing
   spatial fragmentation of the island into clean places for tourists and
   dirty places for residents, reflecting an unequal distribution of the
   waste burden.},

Abstract = {Marine debris, particularly plastic debris is a ubiquitous global
   pervasive problem. The international community recognizes that a
   reduction in plastic debris density is central to sustainable ocean use
   based on reduction performance metrics. Although many national databases
   already exist or are being developed, an internationally accepted index
   of plastic debris density does not currently exist. Standardized methods
   for monitoring marine debris can help inform policy decisions to reduce
   sources marine debris and support mitigation effectiveness. Vietnam
   recently committed to addressing marine debris nationally and
   internationally and developed ambitious targets to manage and reduce
   ocean plastic debris, yet Vietnam does not currently have a national
   marine debris monitoring database. This study identified international
   best practices and standards; developed a marine plastic database for
   accurate, efficient information gathering, management, and reporting;
   and developed a centralized database platform for future marine plastic
   debris management in Vietnam that can be adapted for other
   jurisdictions.},

Abstract = {Polythene bags, more commonly referred to as single-use plastics, are
   lightweight, non-biodegradable materials that pose numerous
   environmental threats. Recent research conducted by researchers and
   textile artists has sought to raise awareness about their effects. This
   studio practice recycled polythene bags into polythene weft yarns,
   interlaced with polyester warp yarns on a broadloom to create fabrics.
   This studio practice took place on the campus of Kwame Nkrumah
   University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, Ghana. Polythene bags
   were converted into yarns in continuous strands using soldering and
   knotting techniques. The studio creative process was guided by
   studio-based practice in accordance with the qualitative research
   design. The findings from the exploration phase and prototyping stage
   provided invaluable insight into creating the final woven fabrics. This
   study demonstrates the possibility of combining polyester warp yarns
   with recycled polythene bags as weft yarns into textile art. It also
   created the needed awareness to reduce the consumption of polythene bags
   in the country. Assessments from the study participants on the
   wearability and comfortability of the woven fabrics revealed that they
   are stiff and rough, making them only suitable as textile art.},

Abstract = {This study uses a large field experiment linked to actual behavior to
   evaluate the effects of an information campaign with and without
   celebrity endorsement on the use of singleuse plastics. We find that
   demand for single use plastics, particularly for plastic straws and
   spoons, is very responsive to information when - and only when - it is
   coupled with our celebrity endorsement. The effect of celebrity
   endorsement is sizeable. Subjects in the treatment with celebrity
   endorsement use around 29\% fewer plastic straws and spoons in the shop
   at the end of the experiment compared with subjects in the control
   group. The impact of our one-shot intervention goes beyond the immediate
   effect measured right after the intervention. It remains significant and
   similar in size around one month after the intervention. Exploratory
   analysis suggests that an isolated information campaign affects
   attitudes, but not behavior, and that it is the celebrity endorsement
   itself that affects behavior.},

Abstract = {Society's use of plastic is increasing, while the ability to properly
   manage plastic waste is decreasing. In response, improved waste
   management systems and the adoption of reusable products made from
   sustainable materials are needed. Municipal governments in the United
   States are beginning to institute policies reducing unlimited free
   access to plastic products such as bags, straws, and Styrofoam. However,
   some state governments in the Great Lakes region, and elsewhere, have
   responded by making these pro-environmental policies illegal. Such
   policies shift the onus of using less plastic to local businesses and
   conscious consumers. In response, this project sought to determine the
   effectiveness of a plastic bag ban, supported by targeted education and
   outreach, at several local businesses in northeast Ohio. Results suggest
   that the initial implementation and non-enforcement phase of the bag ban
   did not lead to a reduction in the use of plastic bags. However, survey
   respondents indicate they are supportive of policies reducing
   accessibility and unlimited availability of plastic bags. Results
   further show most people have access to their own reusable bags and
   support businesses who charge for, or no longer offer, plastic bags. In
   conclusion, voluntary reduction of bag use by customers is not effective
   and store policies or legislation is needed to reduce the use of plastic
   bags.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FUTURES STUDIES},

Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1-14},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {There are many good reasons, ranging from aspirations for greater
   ecological sustainability to inspiring practical business innovations,
   to imagine the future of the Bioeconomy, especially for East African
   countries1 that are still largely agrarian. To engage in such imagining
   this project used a structured action-learning futures methodology with
   the goal of exploring a Bioeconomy strategy for East Africa. The process
   enabled participants to engage their collective-intelligence to consider
   the Bioeconomy in much broader sense, integrating images of future
   production of bio-products into potential society wide dynamics. The
   participants produced a range of scenarios from ones that depicted
   considerable potential for the Bioeconomy with vibrant and sustainable
   business to other more conflict riven futures due to bio-piracy,
   bio-security, environmental degradation among other concerns. The key
   drivers of the futures were seen as conducing policies and nature of
   investments attracted to the sector. Some policy proposals that emerged
   included developing regional and national platforms to bring
   stakeholders together to ensure policy coherence, creating innovation
   platforms to drive R\&D, developing outreach programs to communicate
   Bioeconomy prospects and stimulating demand for bio-products through
   mandates (e.g. ban on single use plastics) and incentives e.g.
   government procurement quotas.},

Abstract = {The increasing demand for single-use plastic-based products worldwide
   has generated immense waste during the last decade. This review aims to
   summarize the current developments of surface-enhanced Raman
   spectroscopy (SERS) for detecting micro- and nanoplastics in a variety
   of samples and environments. Despite the SERS technique being very
   recent for this purpose, its robustness has already been discussed in a
   few analyses focused on well-known pollutants such as phthalates,
   plasticizers, and xenobiotic contaminants from commercially available
   water bottles. Here, the latest advances, obstacles, and perspectives
   are reviewed using SERS detection as a robust alternative for analyzing
   complex samples containing nanoplastic particles present in daily
   consumer products such as wine and vegetables. Moreover, this paper
   describes different SERS substrates developed to overcome the
   limitations for identifying polymer particles at low concentrations.
   Factors contributing to the sensitivity of SERS substrates are discussed
   to show the advantages and limitations of this technique. The broader
   role of SERS as a tool in environmental research is currently explored
   from polluted air and aquatic environments, which can be relevant for
   other fields, such as clinical monitoring and nanotoxicology.},

Title = {The environmental impact of mass coronavirus vaccinations: A point of
   view on huge COVID-19 vaccine waste across the globe during ongoing
   vaccine campaigns},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {813},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {The vaccine innovation is a ubiquitous preventive measure to the
   transmission of highly infectious SARS-COV-2. The ongoing mass
   coronavirus vaccination programmes have inadvertently become the bulk
   producers of biomedical and plastic waste triggering severe impact on
   the environment. The sustainable management of bio hazardous vaccine
   waste in particular; syringes, needles, used/un-used vials and
   single-use plastic equipment is of utmost importance. This perspective
   presents a critical point of view in terms of the generated vaccine
   waste and the subsequent knock-on effect on all aspects of ecosystem.
   The discussion includes dire consequences due to the release of huge
   amount of plastic-based personal protective equipment into marine
   environment. The pivotal crisis of CO2 emission during the manufacture
   and storage of different vaccines has contributed to global warming. The
   unavoidable generation of microfibers upon incineration, autoclaving,
   pyrolysis and open dumping of vaccine waste has further jeopardized the
   environment. In this vein, exploration of biodegradable materials for
   vaccine inoculation and development of green technologies for sound
   waste management is suggested to mitigate the environment pollution. (C)

Title = {3D printed food package casings from sugarcane bagasse: a waste
   valorization study},
Journal = {BIOMASS CONVERSION AND BIOREFINERY},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 OCT 7},
Abstract = {The present work examines the printability, biodegradability, water
   sorption studies, and applicability of sugarcane bagasse (SCB) for
   developing customized three-dimensional food package casings. Material
   supply was found to be extrudable by applying 3.2 bar pressure using a
   1.28-mm diameter nozzle with the speed of the motor at 240 rpm. The
   process parameters for printing were optimized at 500 mm/min printing
   speed, 0.304 +/- 0.003 g/min printing rate, and 0.450 mm nozzle height.
   The printed SCB showed degradation in the soil upon microbial attack.
   The 3D-printed SCB package casings had a water sorption capacity of more
   than 0.07 (g of water/g of solids) at above 50\% relative humidity. An
   applicability test was performed for the storage of cake. The moisture
   content of the packaging increased, and decreased moisture content was
   observed for the cake, over 9 days. The flexural properties were also
   examined for 9 days that suggests the use of SCB packaging for low
   moisture-containing foods. This work explains an alternative approach
   for the replacement of petroleum-based single-use plastic that causes
   serious damage to the environment.},

Title = {Reducing plastic in the operating theatre: Towards a more circular
   economy for medical products and packaging},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {383},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Plastic single-use devices (SUDs) are favoured by healthcare facilities,
   especially surgical departments, for their convenience, sterility, and
   single-use quality assurance. Medical facilities are responsible for
   generating large amounts of CO2 emissions due to resource-intensive
   processes and reliance on single-use plastic products, among other
   factors. Currently, there are knowledge gaps in literature about
   specific types and amounts of plastic products generated by hospitals,
   and more specifically, operating theatres. Existing relevant research
   focuses mostly on waste management solutions, negating the potential
   solutions further up the value chain. While considerations that focus on
   waste management and end-of-life are important, those that span the rest
   of the value chain, including the circular economy and the waste
   hierarchy, are inherently important. This study addresses this knowledge
   gap by quantifying these fractions and making recommendations to reduce
   them. Observations, polymer analysis, and surveys with medical staff
   were conducted at two hospitals in Denmark. Results suggest that the
   current design of medical products and packaging does not consider the
   end-of-life fate of the product, making current sorting and recycling
   options impossible. Recommendations from this study highlight external
   responsibilities such as those of producers and manufacturers to include
   consideration of the end-of-life fate of the product within the design
   phase. These are in addition to internal responsibilities such as the
   use and sorting of these fractions.},

Abstract = {Amidst widespread shortages in the 1980s, consumers in late
   communist-era Eastern Europe strategically carried shopping bags with
   them everywhere in case an opportunity to pick up scarce goods arose.
   After 1989, the routine use of reusable string shopping bags declined in
   favor of single-use plastic bags provided in supermarkets. Over time,
   however, string bags were widely reconstituted as a popular nostalgic
   commodity. This paralleled, in reverse, the trajectory of plastic bags,
   especially those bearing Western branding, which had been desired but
   scarce commodities in the 1980s before postcommunist reforms rendered
   them ubiquitous. In this article, I argue that the shopping bag's
   function as both an instrument of consumption and a potential commodity
   in and of itself helps us better historicize how late communist
   shortage, the rupture of 1989, and the ensuing period of change
   transformed the perception and memory of the role of material objects in
   late twentieth-century Eastern Europe. To ascertain how their embedded
   meaning and social function has been constantly repurposed, I analyze
   representations of shopping bags in print and media culture from the
   1980s and 1990s as well as nostalgic sources created more recently,
   alongside anecdotes and recollections in academic and commercial texts.},

Title = {Anthropomorphism as a Differentiation Strategy for Standardized Reusable
   Glass Containers},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The steadily increasing amount of waste requires new strategies for
   package waste reduction. One strategy is to switch from single-use
   plastic packaging to glass packaging; however, this strategy is only
   beneficial from an environmental perspective when complemented with a
   multi-use deposit refund system with standardized glass containers. This
   implies the loss of package shape as a differentiation criterion, which
   has been considered a highly relevant marketing instrument in the
   fast-moving consumer goods markets. Against this background, the current
   research investigates in an online experiment the suitability of
   anthropomorphized label designs on prompting purchase intentions in the
   context of reusable glass jars. The study further investigates the
   mediating roles of brand attitude and brand interest. Contrary to the
   postulated hypotheses, anthropomorphized labels negatively impact brand
   attitude, and the sequential mediation of anthropomorphism on brand
   interest and brand attitude on purchase intention was significant. Our
   findings reveal that anthropomorphized labels stimulate brand interest,
   which in turn positively affects purchase intention. The results
   emphasize the relevance of brand interest in package design and guides
   manufacturers, brand managers, and policymakers to effective
   differentiation strategies for standardized multi-use packages.},

Abstract = {Recent economic growth has increased human concern for the environment,
   especially in developing countries. Because of this paradigm shift, the
   Chinese population in particular has become more aware of problems with
   plastic pollution. To reduce the usage of single-use plastics in the
   nation, this study intended to ascertain the switching intention of
   Chinese young consumers towards the use of biodegradable plastics.
   Drawing upon the push-pull-mooring model and institutional theory, this
   study investigates the push factors, including environmental threats,
   knowledge, and the strict regulative environment; pull factors,
   including alternative attractiveness and normative environment; and
   mooring factors, such as cost switching and self-efficacy. The important
   findings of this study indicated that all PPM factors except
   environmental knowledge have an impact on the intention of switching to
   biodegradable plastics. It was also found that mooring factors
   significantly moderate switching. We offer important theoretical and
   practical implications for policymakers and businesses.},

Abstract = {The global waste plastic crisis, caused by overconsumption of single-use
   plastics, is threatening ecological systems and public health,
   worldwide. This study presents a novel catalytic conversion of waste
   polyolefinic plastics to low aromatic naphtha for new plastic
   manufacturing by a tandem catalysis process. Zn/SBA-15 was found to be
   an effective heterogeneous catalyst for cracking high density
   polyethylene (HDPE) pyrolytic wax into short chain olefins. This
   catalyst shows a much higher activity than pure catalysts or SBA-15
   catalysts that were modified with other metals. This tandem catalysis
   system was also applicable to catalytic reforming of various waste
   polyolefins including HDPE, low density polyethylene (LDPE), and
   polypropylene (PP), producing high quality naphtha with a C5-C12
   paraffin selectivity of 50-71 \% peak area. Furthermore, the pure and
   real-world plastic mixture can also be used to produce high quality
   naphtha, with a C5-C12 paraffin selectivity of 60.39 \% peak area and
   57.16 \% peak area, respectively. This new plastic to low-aromatic
   naphtha technology highlights the feasibility of upcycling waste
   plastics into virgin plastic products.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the massive generation of
   biomedical waste (BMW) and plastic waste (PW). This sudden spike in BMW
   and PW has created challenges to the existing waste management
   infrastructure, especially in developing countries. Safe disposal of PW
   and BMW is essential; otherwise, this virus will lead to a waste
   pandemic. This paper reviews the generation of BMW and PW before and
   during the COVID-19 pandemic, the regulatory framework for BMW
   management, policy interventions for COVID-19-based BMW (C-BMW), the
   capacity of BMW treatment and disposal facilities to cope with the
   challenges, possible management strategies, and perspectives in the
   Indian context. This study indicated that policy intervention helped
   minimize the general waste treated as C-BMW, especially during the
   second pandemic. Inadequacy of common BMW treatment facilities'
   (CBMWTFs) capacity to cope with the BMW daily generation was observed in
   some states resulting in compromised treatment conditions. Suggestions
   for better management of BMW and PW include decontamination of used
   personal protective equipment (PPEs) and recycling, alternate materials
   for PPEs, segregation strategies, and use of BMW for co-processing in
   cement kilns. All upcoming CBMWTFs should be equipped with higher
   capacity and efficient incinerators for the sound management of BMW.
   Post-pandemic monitoring of environmental compartments is imperative to
   assess the possible impacts of pandemic waste.},

Title = {Do plastic warning labels reduce consumers? willingness to pay for
   plastic egg packaging?-Evidence from a choice experiment},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {198},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Reducing single-use plastic consumption in the food and beverage
   industry has become increasingly important to policymakers as
   non-recycled plastic waste escapes into ecosystems. Plastic waste may
   pose direct and indirect threats to human, animal, and ecosystem health.
   In this paper we examine how warning labels on plastic packaging affects
   consumer valuation for packaged food products. Using a choice experiment
   with a differencein-difference design, we investigate whether putting
   warning labels on plastic egg crates reduces consumers' willingness to
   pay (WTP) for plastic packaging. Our results reveal that warning labels
   are effective at reducing consumers' WTP for plastics. Compared with
   pulp-based packaging, we estimate that plastic warning labels reduce WTP
   for clear plastic packaging on average by \$1.02, and decreased WTP for
   plastic-based foam by \$0.51. However, the effectiveness of the warning
   label depends on the information content of the warning. While labels
   warning against the negative impacts of plastic on health, the
   environment, and safety all reduced WTP for plastic, respondents in the
   health label treatment reduced their WTP by the largest amount.
   Additionally, we find that consumers without pro-environment and
   pro-health attitudes also reduced their WTP for plastics after exposure
   to the plastic warning label.},

Abstract = {The restaurant industry is one of the hardest hit sectors of the
   COVID-19 pandemic. The prolonged closures and declining patrons brought
   about by community lockdowns have imposed financial struggles to
   numerous restaurants and food establishments. As people were forced to
   remain indoors in order to curb the spread of the virus, demand for
   online food delivery service has surged. The growing demand for this
   type of food service is predicted to significantly alter the consumption
   pattern of restaurant patrons, which may accelerate the consumption of
   single-use plastics. In this paper, sustainability challenges relating
   to plastic consumption associated with online food delivery services are
   presented together with recommendations on how to address them. From the
   proposed actions to be implemented, it appears that the online food
   delivery service providers are in a central position to implement
   potentially high-impact actions within a relatively shorter time horizon
   compared with different stakeholders, such as the consumers,
   restaurants, and governments. Thus, encouraging greater accountability
   and initiatives from online food delivery service providers will be
   crucial in the drive for cleaner and responsible consumption of plastics
   derived from food deliveries.},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate the fundamental requirements for
   technical advancement in order to reduce the impact of Carbon Emissions
   during plastic production and to properly utilize plastic waste through
   recycling. It has been analyzed that various products made from recycled
   plastics result significantly low carbon emission in respect to various
   products made from virgin plastics. Component production, product
   assembly, product usage, and disposal or recycling is the four stages
   involved in the creation of a basic plastic product. Energy and raw
   materials are required in each of these processes. To understand
   efficacy of recycled plastics, multilayered plastics has been converted
   to products such as furniture, single use plastics such as plastic bags
   have been converted to pavement tiles and tetra pack has been converted
   to synthetic cotton. These results reveal that manufacturing steps for
   making these products are relatively low in comparison with the products
   are manufactured from virgin plastics. Hence, it has been concluded that
   by applying recycled plastics, it will not only result economically
   viable products but also a green technology leading to low carbon
   emission to the environment.},

Title = {Plastic pollution on Durance riverbank: First quantification and
   possible environmental measures to reduce it},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {3},
Month = {AUG 17},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing issues of our time, with
   negative impacts on natural ecosystems, human health, and the climate
   system. The identification of top litter items discarded in the
   environment is essential to prioritize environmental policies to prevent
   plastic leakage and promote a circular economy. Here, we present the
   first quantification of macrolitter on three sites along Durance
   riverbank and one site on Lake Serre-Pon \& ccedil;on's beach, in the R
   \& eacute;gion SUD-Provence-Alpes-C \& ocirc;te d'Azur, southeastern
   France. Data were collected through citizen science between 2019 and
   2020 in three sampling occasions (autumn, winter, spring) on Durance
   riverbank and in 22 occasions on Lake Serre-Pon \& ccedil;on. A total of
   25'423 litter items were categorized, of which 82\% were plastics.
   Single-use plastic items correspond to 8.13\% of total, while single-use
   plastic bottles are among the top 10 litter items at each site. Median
   litter abundance across all samples is 2,081 items/100 m survey, two
   orders of magnitude higher than European precautionary threshold value
   for marine litter (20 items/100 m survey). The majority of items
   (74.83\%) were small and non-identifiable. Pieces of polystyrene, soft
   plastics and rigid plastics represented the majority of litter items in
   total (56.63\%) and at S1 (89.28\%), S2 (58.95\%) and S3 (79.60\%).
   Glass pieces corresponded to 15.83\% of total litter items. Soft plastic
   pieces are the most abundant litter category overall and correspond to
   58.85\% of litter items at sampling site along Durance riverbank located
   in an agricultural zone, suggesting their source from agricultural
   plastic mulch films. Among the identifiable items, the most abundant
   were plastic biomedia used in waste water treatment plants and
   single-use beverage bottles in plastic and in glass. The development of
   extended producer responsibility schemes for plastic mulch films and
   plastic biomedia and of deposit return schemes for single-use beverage
   bottles is suggested as a way to prevent leakage in the environment.
   This work confirms the opportunity to use citizen science to gather
   relevant data on macrolitter items and to monitor the effectiveness of
   environmental regulations to reduce plastic pollution.},

Abstract = {The huge consumption of single-use plastic straws has brought a
   long-lasting environmental problem. Paper straws, the current
   replacement for plastic straws, suffer from drawbacks, such as a high
   cost of the water-proof wax layer and poor water stability due to the
   easy delamination of the wax layer. It is therefore crucial to find a
   high-performing alternative to mitigate the environmental problems
   brought by plastic straws. In this paper, all natural, degradable,
   cellulose-lignin reinforced composite straws, inspired by the
   reinforcement principle of cellulose and lignin in natural wood are
   developed. The cellulose-lignin reinforced composite straw is fabricated
   by rolling up a wet film made of homogeneously mixed cellulose
   microfibers, cellulose nanofibers, and lignin powders, which is then
   baked in oven at 150 degrees C. When baked, lignin melts and infiltrates
   the micro-nanocellulose network, acting as a polyphenolic binder to
   improve the mechanical strength and hydrophobicity performance of the
   resulting straw. The obtained straws demonstrate several advantageous
   properties over paper straws, including 1) excellent mechanical
   performance, 2) high hydrostability, and 3) low cost. Moreover, the
   natural degradability of the cellulose-lignin reinforced composite
   straws makes them promising candidates to replace plastic straws and
   suggests possible substitutes for other petroleum-based plastics.},

Abstract = {How may local government, nested in state government as a creature of
   state law, effectively engage in collaborative governance? What if it
   finds itself thwarted by state legislation related to policy solutions
   that community stakeholders identify through collaborative governance as
   steps to mitigate climate change? This article examines how state
   legislation may limit or empower local government to use collaborative
   governance to address climate change. It uses Institutional Analysis and
   Development with a particular focus on state law as rules that shape
   municipal action arenas. Legal scholars term state legislation that
   limits local government action as state preemption or intrastate
   preemption. Using a 50-state review of state statutes regarding single
   use plastic bags, fracking, electricity supply, and broadband, this
   article identifies patterns of intrastate preemption of municipal
   government authority to adopt policies or ordinances related to the
   environment. It identifies patterns in states adopting intrastate
   preemption related to majority political party in the state legislature
   and governorship. It concludes intrastate preemption may inhibit
   collaborative governance and community problem-solving by limiting
   municipal policy choices. This research illustrates the importance of
   controlling for state law in research on municipal collaborative
   governance in policy-making.},

Title = {Cost-benefit analysis of two possible deposit-refund systems for reuse
   and recycling of plastic packaging in Sweden},
Journal = {CLEANER WASTE SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {3},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Plastic packaging is a major contributor to the environmental impacts
   associated with the linear plastic production and consumption system due
   to the prevalence of short-lived single-use plastic (SUP) packaging.
   Deposit-refund system (DRS), as an alternative policy instrument to
   Extended Producer Responsibility in waste management, is deemed as a
   potentially promising way to address the failure of the current plastic
   waste management and facilitate circular plastic packaging production
   and consumption for food contact use. In this paper, two DRS scenarios
   for recycling and reuse respectively are explored, with PET trays for
   food-grade use in Sweden in focus. Their costs and benefits are
   investigated relative to the business-as-usual scenario over a 25year
   period. Results show that the costs are greater than the benefits for
   the recycling scenario but not for the reuse scenario and that the
   benefit-cost ratio (1,67) of the reuse scenario is 2.3 times as high as
   that (0,73) of the recycling scenario. The distributive analysis reveals
   major cost drivers such as deposit handling and recycling in the
   recycling case and deposit handling, dishwashing and packaging in the
   reuse case and major cost takers such as materials industry and
   hospitality/supermarkets in both scenarios. However, the results are
   uncertain, as is indicated by sensitivity analysis. Several parameters
   with high uncertainty are identified and highlighted for system
   development and innovation.},

Abstract = {Upcycling waste into value-added products for utilization in wastewater
   abatements has been explored in a number of treatment technologies. One
   such waste, single-use plastic, which poses significant adverse
   environmental and economic impact, has been chosen and converted into
   graphitic carbon to reduce the waste burden sustainably and
   economically. The sorptive and catalytic performance of synthesized
   plastic wastederived carbon (PWC) was evaluated using brilliant green
   (BG) and eosin yellow (EY) as target pollutants. The adsorption capacity
   of PWC was very low for BG (7.41 mg/g) and EY (4.93 mg/g). The coupling
   of PWC with peroxymonosulfate (PMS) promoted dye degradation. Complete
   degradation of the dye, with \~{}61\% reduction in TOC and \~{}95\%
   reduction in toxicity, was achieved by oxidative treatment (initial
   concentration: 10 mg/L). The functionalities of PWC facilitated better
   electron transfer to PMS for its effective activation, which led to the
   production of SO4 center dot- and OH \& BULL;. The quenching study
   confirmed that the degradation of dyes was primarily due to SO4 center
   dot-. Additionally, the pathways of dye degradation were proposed based
   on the intermediates identified. Thus, this study established the high
   potential of PWC as a metal-free catalyst in PMS activation for the
   abatement of organic pollutants.},

Title = {Reducing plastic waste through legislative interventions in the United
   States: Development, obstacles, potentials, and challenges},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE HORIZONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The distribution of more than 100 billion plastic bags every year in the
   United States has caused many environmental problems and an increasing
   number of local and state governments have enacted ordinances and
   legislations to ban or tax single-use plastic bags and other plastic
   products. By February 2022, a total of 11 states had enacted statewide
   plastic bag bans and several other states have proposed similar
   legislative bills. This paper reviews the development of state-level
   plastic bag legislation, discusses the preemption conflicts between
   local and state governments and other obstacles, and assesses the
   potentials and challenges of further plastic bag legislation for
   enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of legislative interventions.
   This study suggests that the United States should start to develop
   federal plastic bag legislation to overcome the preemption conflicts
   between state and local governments, reduce the inconsistencies in
   plastic bag legislations across states, and catch up with many other
   developed nations in plastic waste reduction. Also, public investment in
   research, information dissemination, environmental education, and policy
   assessment should be increased to enhance public awareness of,
   participation in, and support for reducing plastic waste.},

Title = {Environmental Contamination and Chronic Exposure to Endocrine-Disrupting
   Phthalates: An Overlooked and Emerging Determinant for Hormone-Sensitive
   Cancers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE},

Volume = {102},

Abstract = {Despite several modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors of
   hormone-associated cancers have been established, less heed has been
   paid to chemicals, those having the potential to thwart the body's
   normal detox system and affect the endocrine-hormonal pathways.
   Phthalates are endocrine-disrupting chemicals, most widely manufactured
   and used indiscriminately in several industries, including processed,
   ultra-processed and packaged food, single-use plastics, household and
   personal care/cosmetic products including diapers and electronics. The
   general population is regularly being exposed to phthalates on contact
   with these products, especially women and children are most vulnerable.
   It is therefore highly crucial to monitor and evaluate the biological
   burden of plasticizing phthalates in humans and understand the potential
   mechanisms of etiological link between pervasive exposure to phthalates
   and development of chronic diseases such as cancer through epigenetic
   and/or genetic alterations. It is also important to identify sustainable
   and scalable interventions for increasing public awareness, and
   restricting chronic phthalate exposure to individual and the population
   at large through relevant policy legislations, particularly in
   low-income and middle-income countries, such as India.},

Title = {Development of an Adhesive Based on Waste Management as a Mechanism
   Towards Sustainability},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution is an alarming issue; it is a phenomenon that, in
   addition to altering health, is capable of generating damage to the
   environment. It is estimated that only 8\% of plastics are recycled and
   that 76\% end up in landfill sites or are indiscriminately disposed of
   into the environment. ``Single-use{''} plastics contribute the most to
   the generation of pollution due their short ``life cycle{''} since after
   their useful life, they are discarded. Expanded Polystyrene (EPS), one
   of the plastics with the greatest use as a packaging material, has a
   complicated recycling process due to its volume and weight
   characteristics. Based on the above, following the Circular Economy
   model, the optimal development of an adhesive for the cut-sole union is
   addressed through the analysis by classified attributes using an
   orthogonal array L-9(3)(4) of Taguchi. Of the factors under study, it
   was determined that the ``adhesive formulation{''} is the factor that
   statistically significantly influences the degree of adhesion of the
   cut-sole, followed by the ``type of sole{''}. The adhesive with
   post-consumer EPS is viable and contributes to minimizing the
   environmental pollution footprint as a strategy toward sustainability.},

Abstract = {The launch of Roadmap towards Zero Single-use Plastics in 2018 demands
   baseline data on the management of marine debris in Malaysia. In 2021,
   Malaysia is placed 28th top plastic polluter in the world with plastic
   consumption at 56 kg/capita/year, therefore data on mismanaged plastic
   is imperative. This paper reviews the abundance and distribution of
   marine debris in selected Malaysian beaches over the last decade
   (2010-2020) and discusses issue on its management. Plastic debris on
   beaches in Malaysia, was reported to range from 64 items/ m2, to as high
   as 1930 items/m2, contributing 30-45\% of total waste collected.
   Plastics film was the most dominant, mainly originated from packaging
   materials. Therefore, appropriate action including improved marine waste
   management system is crucial to tackle the problem, together with
   effective governance mechanisms. Various suggestions were proposed based
   on the statistical-environmental data to reduce the occurrence of marine
   debris in the country.},

Abstract = {A possible source of microplastics has started to be released into
   nature because of the single-use face masks that protect us against the
   spread of COVID-19 and are being thrown onto the streets and into seas
   and nature. This study aims to estimate the amount of face mask use
   during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey, thereby expressing our concerns
   about waste management and plastic pollution and calling on appropriate
   solid waste management policies and governments to take the necessary
   measures to formulate their strategies at all levels. In this context,
   the number of masks in an area of 1 km(2) in 3 different cities was
   determined theoretically and experimentally. Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were also
   used to evaluate plastic polymer characteristics of the single-use face
   mask. It was determined that the three cities produce roughly 10 tons of
   face masks in a day. With the increasing use of single-use plastics, the
   impact of face masks on microplastic pollution is of great concern.
   Although studies on the recovery of disposable masks continue, the level
   is insufficient. Therefore, studies to be carried out on technologies
   that will enable the repeated use of masks are important.},

Abstract = {This article argues that plastics ought to be included under the
   category of `hazardous' healthcare waste and suggests that health
   professionals should strive for alternatives as part of their mission to
   improve health. The focus of this paper is on replacing, rather than
   recycling, plastics. The rationale for this stance stems from the
   unbridled escalation of plastics use, the fact that few countries have
   significant recycling capacity, and because the process of recycling as
   well as the end products of recycled plastics remain hazardous to health
   and the environment.
   Issues related to incinerated plastic, plastics in single-use items,
   plastic blister packs and containers for medicines, as well as plastics
   which are unrelated to healthcare but which nevertheless make up a
   substantial part of general healthcare waste are discussed. Suggestions
   are put forward to dramatically reduce plastics in all such cases. To
   support needed reforms and to guide best practice for single-use
   plastics in particular, a call for a reliable reference source is
   made-similar to the Essential Medicines Lists, which would share updated
   information on the most problematic items in use and environmentally
   friendly alternatives in each case. It is argued that concerted action
   by health professionals to improve healthcare waste, beginning with
   plastics, would send much needed market signals to industry to produce
   environmentally-friendly products for healthcare and would likely lead
   to solutions for domestic waste, too.},

Abstract = {The unforeseen outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic has significantly
   stipulated the use of plastics to minimize the exposure and spread of
   the novel coronavirus. With the onset of the vaccination drive, the
   issue draws even more attention due to additional demand for vaccine
   packaging, transport, disposable syringes, and other allied devices
   scaling up to many million tonnes of plastic. Plastic materials in
   personal protective equipment (PPE), disposable pharmaceutical devices,
   and packaging for e-commerce facilities are perceived to be a lifesaver
   for the frontline healthcare personnel and the general public amidst
   recurring waves of the pandemic. However, the same material poses a
   threat as an evil environmental polluter when attributed to its
   indiscriminate and improper littering as well as mismanagement. The
   review not only highlights the environmental consequences due to the
   excessive use of disposable plastics amidst COVID-19 but also recommends
   mixed approaches to its management by adopting the combined and
   step-by-step methodology of adequate segregation, sterilization,
   sanitization activities, technological intervention, and process
   optimization measures. The overview finally concludes with some crucial
   way-forward measures and recommendations like the development of
   bioplastics and focusing on biodegradable/bio-compostable material
   alternatives to holistically deal with future pandemics.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in certain types of litter,
   many of which are expected to end up in the marine environment. The
   present study aimed to monitor the pandemic-related litter pollution
   along the Greek coastal environment. Overall, 59 beach and 83 underwater
   clean-ups were conducted. Litter was categorized as: PPE (face masks and
   gloves), COVID-19-related, single-use plastic (SUP) and takeaway items.
   PPE, dominated by face masks (86.21 \%), accounted for 0.29 \% of all
   litter. The average PPE density was 3.1 x 10-3 items m- 2 and 2.59
   items/ 100 m. COVID-19-related items represented 1.04 \% of the total.
   Wet wipes showed higher densities (0.67 \% of all litter) than in the
   pre-COVID era, while no increase in SUP and takeaway items was observed.
   Benthic PPE, dominated by gloves (83.95 \%), represented 0.26 \% of the
   total. The mean PPE density was 2.5 x 10-3 items m- 2.},

Abstract = {The negative impact of the modern-day lifestyle on the environment was
   aggravated during the COVID-19 pandemic through the increased use of
   single-use plastics from food take-aways to medical supplies. Similarly,
   the closure of food outlets and disrupted supply chains have also
   resulted in significant food wastage. As the pandemic rages on, the
   aggravation of increased waste becomes an increasingly urgent problem
   that threatens the biodiversity, ecosystems, and human health worldwide
   through pollution. While there are existing methods to deal with organic
   and plastic waste, many of the solutions cause additional problems.
   Increasingly proposed as a natural solution to man-made problems, there
   are insect solutions for dealing with the artificial and organic waste
   products and moving towards a circular economy, making the use of
   natural insect solutions commercially sustainable. This review discusses
   the findings on how some of these insects, particularly Hermetia
   illucens, Tenebrio molitor, and Zophobas morio, can play an increasingly
   important role in food and plastics, with a focus on the latter.},

Title = {Plastic pollution mitigation-net plastic circularity through a
   standardized credit system in Asia},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {210},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 12: Responsible consumption and
   production and 14: Life Below Water coincide in the targeting of the
   problem of plastic pollution. The problem has been garnering immense
   media attention in the recent years. Efforts to reduce unnecessary
   plastic consumption have been seen in social movements, in corporate
   policies and most noticeably, in regulatory control in the form of bans
   for specific types of single-use plastic items. A paradox exists as,
   arguably, civilization cannot sustain its current developmental momentum
   without the use of plastics, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic
   demanding higher levels of protection and hygiene. An ideal goal for the
   transformation of the plastic value chain is the concept of circular
   economy - the complete return of post-consumer plastic waste (PCPW) for
   repeated re-consumption after recovery and recycling processes. Hence,
   corporate engagement to manage the plastic value chain in ways that
   commit to the creation of circular economies is crucial. While reduction
   and substitution are being pursued, the current scale of the plastic
   production is still expected to remain the same or increase for the next
   few years as life cycle assessments (LCA), test trials of consumer
   acceptance towards novel delivery mechanisms and other forms of
   innovation are emerging. The reduction of plastics in the private-sector
   is allegedly ongoing but still intangible in Asia as daily lives
   continue to rely heavily on single-use plastics and large amounts of
   plastic packaging. While recovery and collection innovations are
   underway for application and are picking up speed, there is still an
   unfathomable amount of marine litter entering waterways, which
   aggravates the bigger-than-ever problem of plastic pollution in Asia.
   Responsible production has long adopted the concept of credits. Carbon
   credits are the most notable one, while palm oil credits are also
   prominently purchased by manufacturers to offset any palm oil content
   that is not yet sourced from certified sustainable suppliers. The
   concept of credits for plastics is currently sporadically seen across
   the world, especially in developing regions of Asia, but remains much
   less explored than their counterparts for other commodities. ``Plastic
   neutrality{''} or ``net plastic circularity{''} in the form of credit
   purchasing by businesses could likely be the final missing piece of the
   puzzle picturing a circular economy, especially as an interim measure
   and later as a component to be integrated into existing and upcoming
   extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes. In theory, the credit
   system could serve as an offsetting mechanism to recover an equivalent
   or higher amount of plastics to be produced by the credit-purchasing
   responsible manufacturer. This paper explores how responsible plastic
   production, accounting, recovery and offsetting could be enabled through
   standardized plastic credits, similar to the existing carbon and
   sustainable palm oil credit systems, could be applied in Asia to achieve
   the goal of recovery of plastics for circularity.},

   Bacterium},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {SEP 27},
Abstract = {Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a common single-use plastic that
   accumulated in the environment because of its non-degradable
   characteristics. In recent years, microbes from different environments
   were found to degrade plastics and suggested their capability to degrade
   plastics under varying environmental conditions. However, complete
   degradation of plastics is still a void for large-scale implications
   using microbes because of the lack of knowledge about genes and pathways
   intricate in the biodegradation process. In the present study, the
   growth and adherence of marine Bacillus species AIIW2 on PET surface
   instigating structural deterioration were confirmed through weight loss
   and hydrophobicity reduction, as well as analyzing the change in bond
   indexes. The genome-wide comparative transcriptomic analysis of strain
   AIIW2 was completed to reveal the genes during PET utilization. The
   expression level of mRNA in the strain AIIW2 was indexed based on the
   log-fold change between the presence and absence of PET in the culture
   medium. The genes represent carbon metabolism, and the cell transport
   system was up-regulated in cells growing with PET, whereas sporulation
   genes expressed highly in the absence of PET. This indicates that the
   strain AIIW2 hydrolyzes PET and assimilated via cellular carbon
   metabolism. A protein-protein interaction network was built to obtain
   the interaction between genes during PET utilization. The genes traced
   to degrade PET were confirmed by detecting the hydrolytic product of
   PET, and genes were cloned to improve PET utilization by microbial
   system as an eco-friendly solution.},

Title = {Biodegradable mulch films produced from soy-filled polymer resins},
Journal = {MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Large quantities of plastic waste from mulch films have accrued in the
   topsoil of agricultural fields across the globe. The costly,
   time-consuming, and laborious task of removing these films, combined
   with the slow mineralization rates of traditional plastics used for
   mulch film has magnified the waste in the last few years. A solution to
   this issue is to replace single-use plastics with biodegradable
   plastics. In this study, several byproducts from the soy protein isolate
   production were blended with biodegradable polymers, including
   poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) and poly(lactic acid)
   (PLA). First, a 20 wt\% of soy waste was compounded with PLA, PBAT/PLA
   (a polymer blend), and polyethylene, and then cast extruded into
   mono-layered films. A combination of soy waste and PBAT/PLA showed
   promising thermal stability and polymer processability for mulch film
   applications and thus was selected for further investigation. The weight
   loss as a function of time in soil environment also shows that the
   down-selected PBAT/PLA/Soy displayed weight loss within a week in a soil
   environment while PBAT/PLA (as a control group) remained unchanged. With
   promising results obtained from this study, a cost-effective
   biodegradable mulch film that does not require collection
   post-harvesting would be feasible.},

Abstract = {Consumption of bottled water creates large amounts of non-biodegradable
   plastic waste that poses a serious threat to marine life. Single-use
   plastic bags have been banned in several states in India. However,
   bottled water usage is still widely prevalent. We use Ajzen's theory of
   planned behaviour to understand how beliefs, attitudes, social norms,
   perceived costs, and perceived benefits affect tourists' intentions to
   reduce bottled water usage. We use visual cues to compare the effect of
   positive and negative framing on tourists' behavioural intentions and
   their willingness to pay an environmental tax. Pro-environmental
   beliefs, attitudes, and social norms affect tourists' intention to carry
   their own water. Perceived costs such as the inconvenience of carrying
   water and changing habits are the primary barriers to eco-friendly
   intentions. Negative visual cues that nudge the tourist to be aware of
   environmental costs increase the willingness to pay an environmental tax
   but do not affect behavioural intentions. Women are more environmentally
   friendly than men, both with respect to behavioural intentions and
   willingness to pay. This study is the first to provide insight into the
   pro-environmental behavioural intentions of Indian tourists. Increasing
   consumer awareness and providing alternatives for clean drinking water
   may reduce bottled water consumption.},

Title = {Towards a circular economy for PET bottle resin using a system dynamics
   inspired material flow model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {383},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {A massive rise in single-use plastic consumption has resulted in
   uncontrollable terrestrial and marine plastic pollution. Waste
   management systems currently do not have sufficient capacity to safely
   dispose of waste plastic. Apart from the plethora of negative
   environmental impacts due to mismanaged plastic waste both inland and in
   the oceans, landfilled plastics represents a significant recoverable
   energy footprint disposed of after a single use or a very short
   lifetime. Recovering these materials could reduce their carbon footprint
   by displacing the production of virgin plastic. The goal of this
   research is to develop a plastics circular economy framework that
   includes critical technological, economic, and policy constraints to
   help decision makers compare end of life options and inform investment
   decisions. In addition to implementing metrics for measuring
   circularity, the framework employs life cycle assessment to compare the
   environmental impact of pathways for improving circularity in the
   plastics economy. A case study exploring the recycling of polyethylene
   terephthalate (PET) bottles from 2020 to 2049 reveals that chemical
   recycling using glycolysis along with improved collection systems
   through drop-off recycling centers will significantly improve the
   circularity of PET bottles as well as reduce carbon footprints by
   displacing virgin PET manufacture. While waste incineration rather than
   recycling shows improved landfill-diversion-based circularity potential,
   it results in a significant increase of greenhouse gas emissions due to
   the combustion process.},

Title = {Environmental Impacts of Personal Protective Clothing Used to Combat
   COVID- 19},
Journal = {ADVANCED SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Personal protective clothing is critical to shield users from highly
   infectious diseases including COVID-19. Such clothing is predominantly
   single-use, made of plastic-based synthetic fibers such as polypropylene
   and polyester, low cost and able to provide protection against
   pathogens. However, the environmental impacts of synthetic fiber-based
   clothing are significant and well-documented. Despite growing
   environmental concerns with single-use plastic-based protective
   clothing, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has seen a significant increase
   in their use, which could result in a further surge of oceanic plastic
   pollution, adding to the mass of plastic waste that already threatens
   marine life. In this review, the nature of the raw materials involved in
   the production of such clothing, as well as manufacturing techniques and
   the personal protective equipment supply chain are briefly discussed.
   The environmental impacts at critical points in the protective clothing
   value chain are identified from production to consumption, focusing on
   water use, chemical pollution, CO2 emissions, and waste. On the basis of
   these environmental impacts, the need for fundamental changes in the
   business model is outlined, including increased usage of reusable
   protective clothing, addressing supply chain ``bottlenecks{''},
   establishing better waste management, and the use of sustainable
   materials and processes without associated environmental problems.},

Title = {Intended and unintended effects of statutory deposit return schemes for
   single-use plastic bottles. Lessons learned from the German experience},

Abstract = {High levels of environmental pollution and low recycling rates have
   triggered a debate on deposit return systems for single-use beverage
   containers (BCs) within the European Union. In 2003, Germany stat u
   torily implemented a deposit for single-use BCs, which operates
   alongside a historically grown deposit system for multi-use bottles. The
   long-standing German practice can be used as a source of relevant
   experiences. These experiences show that the introduction of a single
   use deposit is a double-edged sword: on the one hand, it caused an
   increase in return and recycling rates of single-use BCs. On the other
   hand, there were unintended effects on the long-standing multi-use
   system and, thus, on the endeavor to implement a circular economy where
   reduction and reuse are prioritized rather than recycling. It seems that
   the introduction of a single-use deposit system promotes a narrow mode
   of thinking and a focus on recycling, which hinders the revitalization
   of multi-use BC systems. The EU's debate on single-use deposit lacks
   critical consideration of such unintended effects. The discussion of the
   German experiences might help to avoid unintended effects that hinder
   the establishment of a circular economy.},

Abstract = {The present review is detailed on the microplastics occurrences and
   their size, types besides impacts of microplastics from phytoplankton to
   marine mammals. Hence, the previous studies stated that the impacts of
   microplastics in the marine environment have been compared with the
   interaction of microplastics into marine organisms such as primary and
   secondary producers, fish, crustaceans, molluscs, sponges, marine
   plants, coral reefs, marine mammals and humans. Lastly, there is a need
   to understand the ecotoxicological effects of environmentally relevant
   concentrations of microplastics on the health of aquatic organisms. The
   recycling and reuse of plastic products and the support for research and
   innovation to develop new products to replace single-use plastics are
   also necessary to prevent and reduce plastic pollution. Thus, a
   precautionary approach is urged to be considered and research supporting
   mitigation of plastic pollution should be prioritized by the policy
   makers.(c) 2021 National Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries.

Abstract = {Plastics, with their ubiquitous presence in our daily lives and
   environment, pose an uncomfortable conundrum. Producers and consumers
   are aware of the value of these organic ingredients in material flow,
   yet their persistence and disruption to the ecological milieu
   desperately stipulate a shift in the status quo. Biodegradable
   plastics-as the name suggests-has its appeal in ensuring the safe return
   of carbon to ecosystems by complete assimilation of the degraded product
   as a food source for soil or aquatic microorganisms. However, despite
   more than a decade of commercial presence, these plastics are still far
   from replacing the Development Testing demand for fossil-fuel-based
   commodity plastics. We discuss this apparent disconnect herein through a
   material value chain perspective. We review the current state of
   commercial biodegradable plastics and contrast it against the desired
   state of the zero-waste-focused circular economy. To close the gap, we
   suggest critical research needs concerning the structure and properties
   of biodegradable plastics, testing standards, application development,
   and waste management. The ultimate success in displacing conventional
   plastics with biodegradable alternatives will be predicated on
   collaboration between all stakeholders across the product value chain.},

Abstract = {An increase in the environmental and health concerns over
   fluorochemical-based, wax-based, and extrusion-based paper coatings has
   led to a growing interest in bio-based, biodegradable, and repulpable
   alternatives to obtain water- and oil-repellent coatings. Reported
   herein is a fluorine-free, plastic-free, and cost-effective water and
   grease resistant paper coating approach that utilizes blends of
   corn-starch (S) and a novel chitosan-graft-polydimethylsiloxane (CP)
   copolymer. The hydrophobic and oleophobic performance of the S/CP-coated
   paper was evaluated by varying the ratio of S and CP in the overall
   blend. The S/CP-coated papers were observed to have low cobb60 values
   (water absorptivity) of 13 +/- 0.9 g m(-2) and an excellent kit rating
   (oil resistance) of 12/12. The S/CP-coated paper substrate surface
   profile was analyzed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The
   repulpability of the coated paper is also demonstrated by washing the
   coating materials from the paper and recovering the pulp.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastic, few global engagement and lack of policies
   contribute to the global challenge about plastic marine litter. This
   form of contamination can cause injury and death of marine wildlife.
   Microplastics (>5 mm) represent an important fraction of plastic litter.
   They include the plastic pellets that are used as raw material within
   plastic industry that can be unintentionally spilled into the
   environment during the industrial processes. In an initiative in order
   to facilitate the understanding and communication of plastic pellets as
   a social and environmental problem, we applied the
   Drivers-Activities-Pressures-State changes-Impacts (on Welfare)
   Responses (as Measures) (DAPSI{[}W]R{[}M]) framework to plastic pellets
   chain. We also analyzed possible mitigating measures and their actions
   along the plastic pellets chain. This DAPSI(W)R(M) framework aim to show
   an overview of the plastic pellets chain and solutions for politicians
   and decision makers to help solve this socioenvironmental problem that
   needs the engagement of all stakeholders involved.},

Abstract = {The Circular and Green Economy principles is inspiring new approaches to
   municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs) design and operation.
   Recently, an ever-growing interest is devoted to exploring the
   alternatives for switching the WWTPs from being able to `simply'
   removing contaminants from water to biorefinery-like plants where energy
   and material can be recovered. In this perspective, both wastewater and
   residues from process can be valorised for recovering nutrients (N and
   P), producing value added products (i.e. biopolymers), energy vectors
   and biofuels (i.e. bio-H-2, bio-CH4 and bioethanol). As an additional
   benefit, changing the approach for WWTPs design and operation will
   decrease the overall amount of landfilled residues. In this context, the
   present research is aimed at evaluating the CH4 production potential of
   MWW screening units' residues. While such a stream is typically
   landfilled, the expected progressive increase of biodegradable matter
   content due to the ban on single-use plastic along with the boost of
   bioplastics makes the investigation of different biochemical
   valorisation routes more and more interesting from an environmental and
   economical perspective. Thus, a full-scale data collection campaign was
   performed to gain information on screening residues amount and
   properties and to analyse the relationship with influent flowrate. The
   most relevant residue properties were measured, and lab-scale tests were
   carried out to evaluate the bio-CH4 potential.},

Title = {A flexible risk assessment framework for marine plastic pollution that
   synthesizes waste management and ecological impact data},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {137},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The vast quantity of plastic in the world's ocean poses an urgent
   problem for marine ecosystems and coastal communities. While
   considerable research has aimed to understand how plastics impact marine
   life, there remains a gap in connecting this knowledge with waste
   management practices. Because these practices often determine the end
   fate of plastic items, bridging this gap is critical to reducing the
   flow of harmful plastics into the ocean. The framework proposed here
   identifies policy actions to reduce consumption of high-impact plastics
   using a compound risk score that encompasses both an item's likelihood
   of entering the ocean and its negative ecological impact. We illustrate
   the framework's application using a case study of single-use plastic
   (SUP) consumption at a large Canadian university. We quantified SUPs
   purchased over one year at the University of British Columbia and
   collected data from its associated waste management system to identify
   factors that influence an item's end fate. We used these data to
   estimate the relative risk of items exiting the recycling stream, then
   combined this with published data on the items' marine impacts to
   calculate their compound risk scores. The results identify high-risk
   plastic items to prioritize in waste reduction strategies and lower-risk
   alternatives. The results also highlight specific policy avenues to
   improve the efficiency of the focal waste management system. This
   framework is flexible to diverse contexts, requiring only information
   about plastic consumption and waste management practices. It is thus an
   accessible and useful tool to support local transitions toward a reduced
   marine footprint.},

Abstract = {The emergence of novel respiratory disease (COVID-19) caused by
   SARS-CoV-2 has become a public health emergency worldwide and perturbed
   the global economy and ecosystem services. Many studies have reported
   the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in different environmental compartments, its
   transmission via environmental routes, and potential environmental
   challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. None of these studies have
   comprehensively reviewed the bidirectional relationship between the
   COVID-19 pandemic and the environment. For the first time, we explored
   the relationship between the environment and the SARS-CoV-2
   virus/COVID-19 and how they affect each other. Supporting evidence
   presented here clearly demonstrates the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in soil
   and water, denoting the role of the environment in the COVID-19
   transmission process. However, most studies fail to determine if the
   viral genomes they have discovered are infectious, which could be
   affected by the environmental factors in which they are found.The
   potential environmental impact of the pandemic, including water
   pollution, chemical contamination, increased generation of
   non-biodegradable waste, and single-use plastics have received the most
   attention. For the most part, efficient measures have been used to
   address the current environmental challenges from COVID-19, including
   using environmentally friendly disin-fection technologies and employing
   measures to reduce the production of plastic wastes, such as the reuse
   and recycling of plastics. Developing sustainable solutions to counter
   the environmental challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic should be
   included in national preparedness strategies. In conclusion, combating
   the pandemic and accomplishing public health goals should be balanced
   with environmentally sustainable measures, as the two are closely
   intertwined.},

Abstract = {As local governments wade into policy arenas that extend beyond their
   traditional set of responsibilities - including those associated with
   sustainability and climate change - they are often compelled to explain
   and justify their actions. In this context, issue framing can serve as a
   strategic political tool. The issue of plastic pollution, which has
   simultaneous substantive local and global problem dimensions offers the
   opportunity to examine the factors that influence cities' strategic use
   of proximate and public goods-based issue frames when making a case for
   policy action. Nearly 300 U.S. city governments have passed ordinances
   establishing policies that - either through a ban, fee, or combination
   thereof - aim to reduce the consumption of plastic bags. By coding the
   `purpose' sections of these ordinances, this research identifies nine
   distinct rationales, each of which characterizes the benefits of plastic
   bag reduction as a proximate or public good. Empirical analyses on the
   factors that influence cities' framing decisions finds that having a
   coastal location is associated with the greater use of a general public
   goods frame and that cities with more politically conservative residents
   or with more conservative state governments are less likely to invoke
   rationales related to climate protection in the text of their
   ordinances.},

Year = {2021},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Pollution of coastal environments by anthropogenic debris is a global
   problem that is increasingly in the public eye. We evaluated the
   influence of socioeconomic and geographic factors on common debris items
   at a global scale. We compared debris density and socioeconomic drivers
   of the ten most common items reported on land and the seafloor,
   analyzing data from 22,508 land-based and 7,290 seafloor clean-ups and
   surveys across 116 and 118 countries, respectively. We found debris
   hotspots for different items span numerous countries across all
   continents. This demonstrates that the debris problem is global and
   heterogeneous, pointing to the transboundary nature of the issue and
   necessitating sub-national approaches to implementing effective
   solutions. Food and beverage packaging items, predominantly made from
   single-use plastics, accounted for much of the debris. Hotspots of
   individual debris items were differentially driven by socioeconomic
   factors. In general, total debris counts increased with the value of
   infrastructure, and decreased with national wealth. Highly polluted
   sites occurred in high-infrastructure, low-wealth locations such as
   Athens, Greece; Tunis, Tunisia and Lima, Peru. Based on these findings,
   we identify specific opportunities for policy makers and citizens alike
   to focus efforts aimed at reducing debris entering the environment.},

Title = {Lignocellulosic biomass as renewable feedstock for biodegradable and
   recyclable plastics production: A sustainable approach},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},

Abstract = {Rapid increment in fossil-derived single-use plastic disposal has led to
   human-made plastic mountains and leading to ecological imbalance.
   Therefore, the development of alternative environmentally friendly,
   biodegradable, and biobased plastics using lignocellulosic biomass
   renders sustainability. Lignocellulosic biomass offers an unprecedented
   opportunity to produce renewable fuels, chemicals, and materials for the
   replacement of fossils-based derivatives. The present review
   comprehensively delineates the potential of lignocellulosic biomass to
   produce biodegradable and recyclable plastics and plastic composites.
   Initially, various available pretreatment methods for the deconstruction
   of natural recalcitrance for fuel and chemical production are
   summarized, along with the challenges and scope of the integrated
   biorefinery approach. Energy chemicals such as ethanol, hydrogen
   produced under biorefinery approach may serve as precursor for
   bioplastics productions for sustainable bio future. Recyclable and
   biodegradable polymers such as polyglycolic acid, polyhydroxyalkanoates,
   polylactic acid, polybutylene succinate, polyvinyl alcohol, biobased
   polyethylene, biobased polyethylene terephthalate and cellulose acetate
   have been critically reviewed. Furthermore, the limitations, hurdles,
   and future scope of commercially available biorefinery industries are
   deliberated. Thus, technical development and integration in current
   biorefinery could promote the economical production of biobased
   biodegradable and recyclable plastics, simultaneously addressing waste
   biomass utilization constraints.},

Abstract = {Recycling of single use plastic like milk pouches, oil pouches, etc. for
   high value products can have significant environmental, social and
   economic implications. The present study focuses on the utilization of
   waste milk pouches made out of low-density polyethylene as the bonding
   agent in preparation of plywood panels. Plywood panels with varying
   content of polymeric content (milk pouch layers) were prepared and
   evaluated for physical and mechanical properties. The results indicated
   that with increase in the dosage of milk-pouch content, both physical as
   well as mechanical properties of the plywood improved substantially.
   There was nearly three folds difference in modulus of rupture of panel
   prepared with 80 g/m(2) and 310 g/m(2) polymer content. Similarly,
   tensile strength, modulus of elasticity also increased significantly
   with increase in polymer content. The glue shear strength, which is very
   important for plywood, was found to be influenced by the quantity of
   polymer. Glue shear strength for panel with 80 g/m(2) polymer was 0,75
   MPa which increased to 1,90 MPa in panel with 310 g/m(2) polymer
   content. It was observed that for strong bonding it is essential that
   the quantity of polymer should be sufficient enough to penetrate into
   the pores of wood creating a mechanical interlocking of veneers. The
   study opens up the scope of recycling of waste milk pouches in the
   preparation of formaldehyde free plywood.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this work is to develop and analyze the role of grass
   root level innovations in improving the livelihood of rural or
   semi-urban ecosystems in India through entrepreneurial framework based
   on user need finding and user-involved design. The paper uses an
   analytical study through user need finding to develop an ecofriendly
   carry bag-making machine targeted for livelihood generation leading to
   self-sustained rural and semi-urban low-income-group ecosystems. A
   stratified random sampling strategy and a factor-based analysis using
   analytical hierarchical processing (AHP) and fuzzy AHP are applied for
   inferential analysis to obtain factor scores of each latent variable
   leading to the best innovation pathway. The best grass root innovations
   come through the inferential analysis of responses directly gathered
   from the sector which is most affected. Such an innovation gets
   significant acceptability when the most affected strata gives direct
   feedback pertaining to the innovation that may lead to the creation of a
   sustainable livelihood ecosystem. Solution to two major practical
   problems, viz., (a) creating regular stable employment opportunities to
   people in the bottom of the pyramid and (b) reducing the pollution due
   to single-use plastic carry bags by providing better alternatives have
   been proposed through a grass root innovation approach. The study
   investigates the direct role of product innovation led through opinion
   of stake holders directly involved that results in providing a
   sustainable and long-term livelihood through the proposed
   entrepreneurial framework.},

Title = {Plastics in the time of COVID-19 pandemic: Protector or polluter?},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {759},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has reemphasized the indispensable role of
   plastics in our daily life. Plastics in terms of personal protective
   equipment (PPEs) and other single-use medical equipment along with
   packaging solutions owing to their inherent properties have emerged as a
   life-savior for protecting the health and safety of the frontline health
   workers and the common citizens during the pandemic. However, plastics
   have been deemed as evil polluter due to their indiscriminate littering
   and mismanagement amid increased plastic usage andwaste generation
   during this unprecedented crisis. This article reviews and assesses to
   dwell upon whether plastics in the time of pandemic are acting as
   protector of the public health or polluter of the environment.
   Considering the utilities and limitations of plastic along with its
   management or mismanagement, and the fate, an equitable appraisal
   suggests that the consumers' irresponsible behavior, and attitude and
   poor awareness, and the stress on waste management infrastructure in
   terms of collection, operation, and financial constraints as themajor
   drivers, leading tomismanagement, turn plastic into an evil polluter of
   the environment. Plastic can be a protector ifmanaged properly and
   complemented by the circular economy strategies in terms of reduction,
   recycle and recovery, and thereby preventing leakage into the
   environment. To safeguard the supply chain of PPEs, several
   decontamination techniques have been adopted worldwide ensuring their
   effective reprocessing to prioritize the circular economy within the
   system. Policy guidelines encouraging to adopt safer practices and
   sustainable technical solutions along with consumers' education for
   awareness creation are the need of the hour for preventing plastic to
   turn from protector with high utility to polluter. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {169},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Global demand for plastics, especially in the packaging sector, is
   increasing exponentially due to the worldwide shift from reusable
   plastics to single-use plastics. Packaging plastics consist mainly of
   polyethylene (PE), and polypropylene (PP)). Therefore, PP and PE
   contribute a significant portion of plastic waste polluting terrestrial
   and aquatic environments. In this study, the effect of UV radiation on
   polypropylene exposed to four different environmental conditions (air,
   double distilled water (DDW), potable water and saline water) was
   observed for 30 days. Physical, chemical, and mechanical changes were
   evaluated to assess the potential for mechanical recycling. Results show
   that all physical, mechanical, and chemical properties were severely
   affected for samples exposed to the air environment, followed by DDW and
   potable water medium, causing the material to be less elastic and more
   brittle. Samples exposed to saline water were found to be resistant to
   mechanical changes. Cracks, holes, and flakes were seen in SEM images of
   samples exposed to air and DDW medium, but no changes were seen on the
   surfaces of samples exposed to potable and saline water. Variation in
   surface roughness of samples with changes in their media was observed in
   AFM 2D topographical images. Changes observed in samples exposed to
   different media suggest that PP recovered from the terrestrial
   environment gets fragmented within 1 month making it difficult to
   collect and therefore, it is no longer fit for recycling. However, PP
   recovered from the marine environment does not deteriorate within 1
   month and can be sent for recycling.},

Abstract = {The last decade increasing attention to litter accumulation in the
   marine environment revealed the issue of the terrestrial fluxes of
   plastic pollution into the oceans. However, limited studies investigate
   the macro-litter abundance and composition particularly in freshwater
   ecosystems and the adjusted coastal environment. In this study, we
   conducted an empirical analysis of anthropogenic litter (AL) in two
   freshwater streams and their estuaries of Lesvos island (Greece),
   strongly affected by the waste mismanagement in the Moria refugee camp.
   A total of 1,622 litter items were collected from five sites during the
   field campaign between the 3rd and 6th of June 2019. Among these,
   artificial polymer items (mainly drink bottles, single-use plastic bags,
   cutlery, and trays) irrespective of the site location constituted the
   major part ranging from 46 to 91\% of total AL by mass. Drink bottles
   and plastic cutlery are found in higher percentage at Moria camp river
   and its estuary, while packaging and bag litter are more abundant at
   upstream sites. The operation of the camp has increased the AL abundance
   13 times more than the reference site, causing severe threat to human
   health and to freshwater and marine environment. It is therefore
   important to improve the waste management system at (inter)national
   (change in production and packaging policy) and local scale (introducing
   sustainable solutions to refugee camp design) by promoting recycling and
   circular economy projects to diminish AL pollution.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Patient-oriented research (POR) and patient engagement (PE) has
   highlighted the value of incorporating patients' ideas and priorities in
   health research. Using the guiding principles of POR and PE, the current
   study conducted PE sessions to gain insight on the perceptions of
   mothers regarding the costs of infant feeding. Methods: Four patient
   engagement sessions were held with mothers residing in Newfoundland and
   Labrador between November 2019 and January 2020. Mothers were targeted
   through the Brighter Futures Coalition of St. John's, a not-for-profit
   community organization. PE sessions were designed in a two-hour format,
   allowing the research team to engage mothers and identify costs of
   infant feeding from a mothers' perspective. Results: Through the guiding
   principles of patient-oriented research and patient engagement, our
   research team successful engaged with mothers in discussions surrounding
   the costs of infant feeding. The sessions allowed for an in-depth
   discussion surrounding monetary costs (eg, incidentals of breast or
   formula feeding), the associated costs of infant feeding and the
   workplace (eg, perceived productivity) and environment impacts (eg,
   single use plastics). During each session, evaluations were provided to
   solicit feedback on whether the goals and expectations of mothers had
   been met, and whether they felt their opinions were heard and
   understood. Conclusion: By conducting patient engagement sessions,
   informed by patient-oriented research guiding principles, we were able
   to successfully recruit and engage mothers in discussions that led to a
   better understanding of their perspectives on the costs of infant
   feeding.},

Abstract = {The problems of plastic pollution are increasing and have been linked to
   sustainability efforts. Some communities have tried to tackle this issue
   by implementing `plastic free' initiatives, such as the `Plastic Free
   Community'. Community initiatives foster change and encourage improved
   environmental outcomes; however, it is unclear if `plastic free'
   initiatives have the capacity to `snowball' into further sustainable
   behaviors or if they are a `distraction' from more pressing
   environmental issues. This study presents the behavioral changes,
   snowball and distraction effects from the first Scottish mainland
   `plastic free community' initiative. The pilot study of `Plastic Free
   Anstruther' (Scotland) identifies self-transcending values and locus of
   control as important drivers for change, but adoption of single-use
   plastic alternatives and a `single use' mindset resulted in a limited
   `snowball' effect. Future `Plastic Free Community' initiatives should
   focus on encouraging more circular approaches and individual behavior
   change to reduce waste and improve environmental outcomes. While the
   initiative resulted in greater awareness of wider environmental issues,
   additional incentives for individual and business pro-environmental
   behavior could further improve economic, social and environmental
   sustainability.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastics emanating from the food and beverage industry are
   polluting the environment, and there is increasing public pressure to
   find `green' solutions to plastic pollution. The introduction of more
   bio-based and biodegradable plastics (possibly manufactured by
   disruptive technologies), increased plastic recycling, and enhanced
   degradation of plastics (micro, meso, and macro) in the environment can
   holistically contribute to solving the problem for future generations.
   In order to inform future research, it is imperative that robust
   background data and information are available. This review provides
   details about the volumes and categories of food and beverage packaging
   manufactured and recycled, and available data (qualitative and
   quantitative) on environmental plastic pollution in South Africa, and to
   a lesser extent, in Europe and globally. In addition, current and future
   trends and technologies for recycling, enhanced degradation, and
   manufacturing of plastics are discussed, with an emphasis on the
   manufacture of bioplastics.
   Significance:
   Plastic pollution needs to be tackled through a holistic combination of
   reduced use, enhanced recycling efforts, public education about
   littering, replacement of selected conventional plastics by degradable
   alternatives, and enhanced degradation of plastics in the environment.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastic packaging is a cause of rising environmental concerns
   due to high production volumes, short usage time, and problems related
   to end of life management and release into the environment. As a result,
   there is an increased demand to develop alternative non-plastic
   packaging from agricultural waste materials. This paper reported
   findings for converting, via atmospheric refining, waste oil palm empty
   fruit bunch (EFB) fibres into a fibrous pulp which can then be used to
   produce three-dimensional pulp moulded products. By optimising the mould
   design, the efficiency of vacuum suction was improved, which in turn
   helped to improve fibre distribution and the quality of moulded trays;
   such moulded trays are suitable for the containment of food items such
   as fruit and vegetables. Furthermore, when combined with compostable
   barrier treatments, lidding and adhesive films currently under
   development, there is an opportunity to provide a complete
   biocompostable packaging solution for some food items. Furthermore, as
   these pulp moulded packaging products are made from agricultural fibre
   wastes rather than plastics, the pulp moulded trays are recyclable or
   compostable at the end of life. Therefore, if a release does occur into
   the environment, it would not persist.},

   laboratory report},
Journal = {PLOS SUSTAINABILITY AND TRANSFORMATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {1},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Laboratories globally contribute significantly to consumption of
   resources, greenhouse gas emissions, and generation of waste. Shellfish
   destined for human consumption are required to be tested for the
   presence of regulated marine biotoxins, that can be harmful to human
   health. Whilst running the national monitoring program for the detection
   of biotoxins in shellfish, efforts were made to increase resource
   efficiencies by reducing waste and energy consumption leading to reduced
   environmental and financial costs. Methods were verified to allow
   transitions to more sustainable and environmentally-friendly
   consumables, replacing plastics with paperboard and glass alternatives,
   leading to a reduction in the consumption of single-use plastics by
   69\%. A shift to polystyrene recycling and composting non-toxic
   shellfish waste led to an overall reduction in non-chemical waste of
   >95\%. Adoption of green analytical chemistry principles to procurement
   and preparation of chemical solutions led to a reduction in hazardous
   chemical waste by -23\%. A further reduction in printing (-81\%) was
   achieved by transitioning to digital document control. Strategies to
   reduce energy consumption through `switch off' campaigns and improved
   fume hood and cold storage equipment management were also implemented.
   Fume hood and cold storage equipment energy consumption was reduced by
   30\%. The strategies implemented could be adopted by other laboratories
   e.g., monitoring and research laboratories dealing with pharmaceutical,
   biological, and environmental samples.},

Abstract = {Among the environmental problems of the 21st century, waste production
   and management are particularly pressing. Despite policy efforts, waste
   volumes are still increasing worldwide and landfilling remains the main
   disposal option in several parts of the world. Together with the huge
   environmental impacts of the large amounts of waste landfilled, it would
   be possible to save enormous amounts of resources improving reuse and
   recycle options. The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak has been
   significant also in the waste cycle, leading to an increase in the
   amount of non-recyclable consumption in response to sanitary needs, as
   well as to new consumption practices. On the basis of these
   considerations this paper aims at analysing: (i) the short run impact on
   output, consumption and health of appropriate waste policies aimed at
   reducing non-recyclable waste production, and (ii) to highlight the
   mechanics triggered by an exogenous pandemic event in terms of waste
   management, environmental and health impacts. To these ends, we adopt an
   E-DSGE approach. Our results confirm the relevance of policies and
   consumers' preferences in driving waste management towards a circular
   economy transition. More importantly, our (to our knowledge) novel
   analysis suggests the existence of a trade-off between environmental
   quality and health in the presence of a pandemic event, suggesting the
   need to increase preparedness to such events, in order to avoid relying
   on ``emergency approaches ``, based on resorting to increases in
   non-recyclable consumption types (e.g. single use plastics).},

Abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, many positive shifts have been observed in
   the ecosystem, with a significant decrease in the greenhouse gas
   emissions and air pollution. On the other hand, there were unavoidable
   negative shifts due to a surge in demand for plastic products such as
   food and groceries' delivery packaging, single-use plastics, medical and
   personal protective equipment to prevent transmission of COVID-19.
   Plastic pollution can be considered as a key environmental issue in
   world due to the huge footprints of plastics on natural ecosystems and
   public health. Herein, we presented an overview on the rise of plastic
   pollution during the COVID-19 pandemic. The potential sources of plastic
   waste during COVID-19 with its negative effects on the environment such
   as marine ecosystems and the global economics are highlighted. We also
   suggested some strategies and recommendations to tackle plastic leakages
   by applying feedstock recycling, sterilization, and with the use of
   biodegradable plastics that have become a sustainable alternative to
   fossil fuel plastics. Also, the importance of elevating public awareness
   and some recommendations to mitigate plastic generated during the
   pandemic has been addressed as well.},

Abstract = {With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019, and the
   catastrophe faced by the world in 2020, the food industry was one of the
   most affected industries. On the one hand, the pandemic-induced fear and
   lockdown in several countries increased the online delivery of food
   products, resulting in a drastic increase in single-use plastic
   packaging waste. On the other hand, several reports revealed the spread
   of the viral infection through food products and packaging. This
   significantly affected consumer behavior, which directly influenced the
   market dynamics of the food industry. Still, a complete recovery from
   this situation seems a while away, and there is a need to focus on a
   potential solution that can address both of these issues. Several
   biomaterials that possess antiviral activities, in addition to being
   natural and biodegradable, are being studied for food packaging
   applications. However, the research community has been ignorant of this
   aspect, as the focus has mainly been on antibacterial and antifungal
   activities for the enhancement of food shelf life. This review aims to
   cover the different perspectives of antiviral food packaging materials
   using established technology. It focuses on the basic principles of
   antiviral activity and its mechanisms. Furthermore, the antiviral
   activities of several nanomaterials, biopolymers, natural oils and
   extracts, polyphenolic compounds, etc., are discussed.},

Abstract = {Rivers are one of the major pathways for the transportation of
   microplastics (MPs) from land-based sources to the ocean. However, there
   are only a few studies on MPs in freshwater environments, particularly
   in Asian countries. In this study, MP contamination in the Chao Phraya
   River in selected locations distributed throughout Bangkok, Thailand was
   investigated. MPs were collected using a Manta net with a mesh size of
   335 mu m. After digestion and distinction based on density, MPs were
   observed using a stereomicroscope, and polymer types were identified
   using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. MP concentrations
   detected in the five sampling locations of the river water from upstream
   to downstream were 11, 35, 40, 15, and 4 particles/m(3), with an average
   concentration of 21 +/- 16 particles/m(3). Most MPs were identified as
   either fragments or sheets/films. Polypropylene was the dominant polymer
   type. The number of MPs increases as their size decreases. Potential
   sources of MPs may include the degradation of single-use plastic
   products, especially, containers and plastic packaging. MP
   concentrations and characteristics varied for different locations,
   indicating different sources and pathways of MPs in urban contexts.
   Further investigation on the different pathways of the transportation of
   MPs to river water from land-based sources is required.},

Abstract = {Extended shelf-life of many foods is a modern requirement that has been
   achieved by means of fossil-based plastic films despite their
   environmental issues. Recently, starch-based, fully biodegradable
   thermoplastics are gaining momentum as packaging material; however, if
   they are in contact with food, aspects such storage, water interaction
   and spoilage due to microorganisms must be considered. Essential oils
   are of great interest due to their antimicrobial action, so
   incorporating these compounds into natural polymers can promote a longer
   shelf life through active packaging. In this study, antibacterial
   activity, optical, mechanical and barrier properties of thermoplastic
   starch (TPS) films based on cassava starch (Manihot esculenta Crantz)
   and rosemary essential oil (REO) were studied. Furthermore, the effect
   of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) on TPS properties were surveyed. Film
   mechanical properties and those related to the interaction with water,
   showed that the highest resistance and barrier properties corresponded
   to the TPS/CNC 15\% film, while adding oil to the films increased
   morphological heterogeneity, contributed to reduce tensile strength, and
   increased water solubility and water vapor permeability. Likewise, TPS
   films containing rosemary oil showed enhanced antibacterial activity
   mostly against E. coli and S. aureus bacteria and A. niger fungus.
   Therefore, adding essential oils as natural additives favors using these
   biocomposites as functional packaging, and as potential replacements for
   single-use plastics.},

Abstract = {Styrene is a nonpolar organic compound used in very high volume for the
   industrial scale production of commercially important polymers such as
   polystyrene resins as well as copolymers like acrylonitrile butadiene
   styrene, latex, and rubber. These resins are widely used in the
   manufacturing of various products including single-use plastics such as
   disposable cups and containers, protective packaging, heat insulation,
   and so forth. The large-scale utilization leads to the over-accumulation
   of styrene waste in the environment causing deleterious health risks
   including cancer, neurological impairment, dysbiosis of central nervous
   system, and respiratory problems. To eliminate the accumulating waste.
   Microbial enzyme-based system represents the most environmental friendly
   and sustainable approach for elimination of styrene waste. However,
   comprehensive understanding of the enzyme-substrate interaction and
   associated pathways would be crucial for developing large-scale disposal
   systems. This study aims to understand the molecular interaction between
   the protein-ligand complexes of the styrene catabolic reactions by
   bacterial enzymes of sty operon. Molecular docking analysis for
   catalytic enzymes namely, styrene monooxygenase (SMO), styrene oxide
   isomerase (SOI), and phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (PAD) of the
   bacterial sty operon was carried out with their individual substrates,
   that is, styrene, styrene oxide, and phenylacetic acid, respectively.
   The binding energy, amino acids forming binding cavity, and binding
   interactions between the protein-ligand binding sites were calculated
   for each case. The obtained binding energies showed a stable association
   of these complexes indicating the future scope of their utilization for
   large-scale bioremediation of styrene, and its commercially used
   polymers and copolymers.},

   hydrocarbons and recommendations for COVID-19 waste management},

Abstract = {A vast amount of plastics are produced globally to comply with human
   needs. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic enabled an extreme rise in
   single-use plastic, creating an extra burden on plastic waste handling
   and promoting environmental pollution. Thermochemical conversion of
   plastic wastes into liquid hydrocarbons would be promising in this
   context. Numerous literature showed plastic-to-liquid hydrocarbon fuel
   formation; however, jet-fuel grade hydrocarbons generation from plastics
   is rarely assembled and hence become the focus of the current review.
   Reportedly, 200 - 600 degrees C reaction temperature, 10 bar hydrogen
   pressure, 12 hrs retention time, and 0.13 catalyst-to-feed ratio
   produced jet fuel from plastics; albeit, it remained system-specific,
   including batch and continuous processes. Critical evaluation of several
   plastics to jet-fuel techniques suggested research attention in (i)
   complete plastic conversion into the plastic-derived oil, (ii) catalyst
   selection and new design enabling aliphatic/aromatics selectivity within
   the product mixture, (iii) mechanistic understanding of plastic to
   jet-fuel processes (with and without catalyst), and (iv) catalyst
   recyclability studies. Thermal degradation under microwave, hydrothermal
   liquefaction, pyrolysis, methanolysis/hydrogenation, thermal
   cracking/cohydroge-nation, and aqueous phase hydrodeoxygenation are
   possible routes for plastic to jet-fuel conversion. Catalytic pyrolysis
   could be a promising for plastic/COVID-19 thermochemical conversion into
   jet fuel, and biomass-derived catalysts may replace the expensive
   metal-based catalysts.},

Title = {Abundance and characterization of personal protective equipment (PPE)
   polluting Kish Island, Persian Gulf},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Plastic pollution is one of the major environmental threats the world is
   facing nowadays, which was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. In
   particular, multiple reports of single-use plastics driven by the
   pandemic, namely personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g., face masks
   and gloves), contaminating coastal areas have been published. However,
   most studies focused solely on counting and visually characterizing this
   type of litter. In the present study, we complement conventional reports
   by characterizing this type of litter through chemical-analytical
   tech-niques. Standardized sampling procedures were carried out in Kish
   Island, The Persian Gulf, resulting in an average density of 2.34 x 10-4
   PPE/m2. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy confirmed the
   polymeric composition of weathered face masks and showed the occurrence
   of additional absorption bands associated with the photooxida-tion of
   the polymer backbone. On the other hand, the three layers of typical
   surgical face masks showed different non-woven structures, as well as
   signs of physical degradation (ruptures, cracks, rough surfaces),
   possibly leading to the release of microplastics. Furthermore, elemental
   mapping through energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy showed that the
   middle layer of the masks allocated more elements of external origin
   (e.g., Na, Cl, Ca, Mg) than the outer and inner layers. This is likely
   to the overall higher surface area of the middle layer. Furthermore, our
   evidence indi-cates that improperly disposed PPE is already having an
   impact on a number of organisms in the study area.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastics (SUPs) are increasingly polluting terrestrial,
   coastal, and marine habits, contributing to the creeping ``plastic
   crisis.{''} The COVID-19 pandemic provided a window of opportunity for
   decision makers to change the degree of urgency and responsiveness to
   this crisis and for policy entrepreneurs and industry who are against
   reducing plastic consumption to influence decision makers to change
   their position on various plastic-related issues. Hygiene/health
   concerns have been used as a justification by governments and industry
   to increase the use of SUPs resulting in a reversal in, or a
   reprioritization of, policy decisions. Through the Multiple Streams
   Framework (MSF), I examine how creeping crises become secondary to
   urgent crises through agenda setting that is influenced and leveraged by
   policy entrepreneurs. I explore examples of such plastic policy
   decisions finding that they have been politically driven and influenced
   by entrepreneurs and industry rather than being primarily based on
   health concerns. Related ArticlesDiaz-Kope, Luisa, and John C. Morris.

Abstract = {An estimated 19-23 million metric tons of global plastic waste
   reportedly entered aquatic environments in 2016 with mounting evidence
   that plastic marine debris causes ecological effects across all levels
   of biological organization in aquatic systems. Scientific conferences
   generate opportunities for waste through food and beverage services,
   giveaways, marketing and registration materials, poster and trade
   exhibits, attendee travel, lodging services, and local transportation.
   Zero waste measures instituted at the Sixth International Marine Debris
   Conference resulted in the avoidance of 76,300 single-use items. Zero
   waste is a process defined by a spectrum of actions ranging from no
   reduction whatsoever to generation of absolutely no waste. Achieving
   100\% zero waste is very difficult. Deciding where on the spectrum you
   wish to land and being comfortable with that target is paramount for
   event planning. Planning for reduced waste takes time, funding, and
   determination, but environmentally-themed organizations have a
   responsibility to lead by example.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastics (SUPs) have become an essential constituent of our
   daily life. It is being exploited in numerous pharmaceutical and
   healthcare applications. Despite their advantages and widespread use in
   the pharma and medical sectors, the potential clinical problems of
   plastics, especially the release of micro-nanoplastics (MNPs) and
   additives from medical plastics (e.g. bags, containers, and
   administrative sets) and sorption of drugs remain understudied.
   Certainly, the MNPs are multifaceted stressors that cause detrimental
   effects to the ecosystem and human health. The origin and persistence of
   MNPs in pharmaceutical products, their administration to humans,
   endurance and possible health implication, translocation, and excretion
   have not been reviewed in detail. The prime focus of this article is to
   conduct a systematic review on the leaching of MNPs and additives from
   pharmaceutical containers/administrative sets and their interaction with
   the pharmaceutical constituents. This review also explores the primary
   and secondary routes of MNPs entry from healthcare plastic products and
   their potential health hazards to humans. Furthermore, the fate of
   plastic waste generated in hospitals, their disposal, and associated
   MNPs release to the environment, along with preventive, and alternative
   measures are discussed herein.},

   Consumer Behaviors in Reducing Food Waste and Plastic Packaging},

Abstract = {Food-related consumer decisions have an impact on the environment.
   However, trending patterns of sustainable consumption often pose a
   challenge for food-safety authorities: these initiatives may
   unintentionally compromise food safety. The objective of this review is
   to support public agencies in the integration of sustainability issues
   into food-safety risk communication schemes. Environmentally conscious
   but risky behaviors aimed at the reduction of food waste and plastic
   packaging were chosen for discussion and scrutinized based on expert
   opinions. Those expert opinions clearly indicated that a significant
   part of environmentally conscious behaviors, such as removing mold,
   eating expired perishable food, overstoring leftovers, avoiding
   single-use plastic packaging even when cross-contamination is a threat,
   and using reusable bags without cleaning for a long time, often
   contribute to food-safety risks. Short, easy-to-remember messages were
   collected for each recognized risky behavior; they concentrated on
   prevention or providing an alternative that was still environmentally
   sensible but kept food-safety risks low (such as planning ahead to avoid
   leftovers, freezing leftovers in time, and sanitizing reusable bags).
   The identified challenges and solutions might encourage authorities to
   rethink their risk-communication practices and integrate a
   sustainability aspect in them.},

Abstract = {The global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to a
   significant health emergency to adverse impact on environment, and human
   society. The COVID-19 post-pandemic not only affects human beings but
   also creates pollution crisis in environment. The post-pandemic
   situation has shown a drastic change in nature due to biomedical waste
   load and other components. The inadequate segregation of untreated
   healthcare wastes, chemical disinfectants, and single-use plastics leads
   to contamination of the water, air, and agricultural fields. These
   materials allow the growth of disease-causing agents and transmission.
   Particularly, the COVID-19 outbreak has posed a severe environmental and
   health concern in many developing countries for infectious waste. In
   2030, plastic enhances a transboundary menace to natural ecological
   communities and public health. This review provides a complete overview
   of the COVID-19 pandemic on environmental pollution and its
   anthropogenic impacts to public health and natural ecosystem considering
   short- and long-term scenarios. The review thoroughly assesses the
   impacts on ecosystem in the terrestrial, marine, and atmospheric realms.
   The information from this evaluation can be utilized to assess the
   short-term and long-term solutions for minimizing any unfavorable
   effects. Especially, this topic focuses on the excessive use of plastics
   and their products, subsequently with the involvement of the scientific
   community, and policymakers will develop the proper management plan for
   the upcoming generation. This article also provides crucial research gap
   knowledge to boost national disaster preparedness in future
   perspectives.},

Title = {Macroplastic accumulation in roadside ditches of New York State's Finger
   Lakes region (USA) across land uses and the COVID-19 pandemic},

Abstract = {Macroplastics are a ubiquitous and growing environmental contaminant
   with impacts in both marine and terrestrial systems. Marine sampling has
   dominated research in this field, despite the terrestrial origins of
   most plastic debris. Due to the high surface water connectivity
   facilitated by roadside ditches, these landscape features provide a
   unique sampling location linking terrestrial and surface water systems.
   We collected and analyzed macroplastic accumulation by number of pieces,
   mass, and polymer type in roadside ditches across four land uses, before
   and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Finger Lakes Region of New York
   State. Commercial land use plastic accumulation rate was highest, while
   forested land use accumulation rates were lowest on a piece basis.
   Pre-COVID-19 piece accumulation rates were significantly higher than
   COVID-19 piece accumulation rates across all land uses. Mass
   accumulation rates followed similar patterns observed in piece
   accumulation, but the patterns were not always statistically
   significant. Plastic type 4 (i.e. thin plastic films), especially
   plastic bags and wrappers, was the most frequently collected type of
   macroplastic by piece across all land uses within the 1-7 Resin
   Identification Codes. By mass, the data were distributed less
   consistently across land uses. Cigarette filters, containing the polymer
   cellulose acetate, were the most frequently found roadside plastic, but
   are not within the 1-7 classification system. Our results suggest that
   policies in place limiting plastic bag usage could substantially reduce
   roadside plastics but other plastics, such as food wrappers and other
   single use plastic films, which comprised a large proportion of the
   plastic debris collected, should also be regulated to further decrease
   macroplastic pollution.},

Abstract = {Plastic pollution is a major environmental concern due to its
   deleterious effects on various ecosystems. The limitations and
   shortcomings of waste management strategies has led to the
   over-accumulation of plastic waste, mainly comprised of single-use
   plastics, such as polystyrene (PS). Considering the advantages of
   biotransfor-mation over the other plastic disposal methods, it has
   become a major focus of the modern research. Biotrans-formation of
   plastics involves its microbial hydrolysis into short chain oligomers
   and monomers that are eventually assimilated as carbon source by the
   microbes leading to the release of CO2. As fungi are known to possess
   multifarious and highly regulated enzyme system capable of utilizing
   diverse nutrient sources, the present study explored the potential of
   Lichtheimia ramosa AJP11 towards myco-transformation of polystyrene
   sulfonate (PSS), a structural analogue of polystyrene (PS). During the
   30-day incubation period of L. ramosa AJP11 in minimal salt medium
   (MSM)+1\% PSS, the fungus showed 41.6\% increment in its fresh weight
   biomass, indicating the utilization of PSS as sole carbon source.
   Further analysis revealed the generation of various re-action
   intermediates such as alkanes and fatty acids, crucial for the continuum
   of fungal metabolic pathways. Moreover, detection of PS oligomers such
   as cyclohexane and 2,4-DTBP confirmed the myco-transformation of PSS.
   The extracellular fungal protein profile showed considerable
   overexpression of a 14.4 kDa protein, char-acterized to be a hydrophobic
   surface binding (Hsb) protein, which is hypothesized to adsorb onto the
   PSS to facilitate its transformation. Further, in silico analysis of Hsb
   protein indicated it to be an amphiphilic alpha-helical protein with
   ability to bind styrene sulfonate unit via both hydrogen and hydrophobic
   interactions, with a binding energy of-5.02 kcal mol-1. These findings
   open new avenues for over expression of Hsb under controlled reactor
   conditions to accelerate the PS waste disposal.},

Abstract = {Plastic waste represents one of the largest environmental problems of
   the modern era and disposable water bottles comprise a substantial
   portion of that waste in the U.S. Colleges are in a unique position to
   create systems that foster sustainable behaviors among their
   constituents. Since 2015, Allegheny College has installed water refill
   stations, and initiated a free water bottle program and an awareness
   campaign to reduce single-use bottles on the college's campus. Two
   surveys were distributed to the student body between 2018 and 2019 to
   assess the efficacy of those initiatives and learn about any barriers.
   Bottled water use has reduced significantly since 2014, with the
   majority of students stating that they most commonly drink water from
   refill stations while on campus. Demographic factors like income, sex,
   or place of origin were not related to the amount of bottled water
   consumption or type of water preference among students. The primary
   barrier to students eliminating disposable water bottle use was found to
   be a lack of water refill stations in dormitories. Research aimed at
   changing behaviors to benefit the environment should consider the
   barrier of convenience. This research provides a valuable lesson that
   can extend beyond college campuses and into public settings.},

Abstract = {The abundance of synthetic polymers has increased due to their
   uncontrolled utilization and disposal in the environment. The
   recalcitrant nature of plastics leads to accumulation and saturation in
   the environment, which is a matter of great concern. An exponential rise
   has been reported in plastic pollution during the corona pandemic
   because of PPE kits, gloves, and face masks made up of single-use
   plastics. The physicochemical methods have been employed to degrade
   synthetic polymers, but these methods have limited efficiency and cause
   the release of hazardous metabolites or by-products in the environment.
   Microbial species, isolated from landfills and dumpsites, have utilized
   plastics as the sole source of carbon, energy, and biomass production.
   The involvement of microbial strains in plastic degradation is evident
   as a substantial amount of mineralization has been observed. However,
   the complete removal of plastic could not be achieved, but it is still
   effective compared to the pre-existing traditional methods. Therefore,
   microbial species and the enzymes involved in plastic waste degradation
   could be utilized as eco-friendly alternatives. Thus, microbial
   biodegradation approaches have a profound scope to cope with the plastic
   waste problem in a cost-effective and environmental-friendly manner.
   Further, microbial degradation can be optimized and combined with
   physicochemical methods to achieve substantial results. This review
   summarizes the different microbial species, their genes, biochemical
   pathways, and enzymes involved in plastic biodegradation.},

Title = {Environmental microplastic and nanoplastic: Exposure routes and effects
   on coagulation and the cardiovascular system},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {291},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution has been a growing concern in recent decades due to
   the proliferation and ease of manufacturing of single use plastic
   products and inadequate waste and recycling management. Microplastic,
   and even smaller nanoplastic, particles are persistent pollutants in
   aquatic and terrestrial systems and are the subject of active and urgent
   research. This review will explore the current research on how exposure
   to plastic particles occurs and the risks associated from different
   exposure routes: ingestion, inhalation, and dermal exposure. The effects
   of microplastics on the cardiovascular system are of particular
   importance due to its sensitivity and ability to transport particles to
   other organ systems. The effects of microplastics and nanoplastics on
   the heart, platelet aggregation, and thrombus formation will all be
   explored with focus on how the particle characteristics modulate their
   effect. Plastic particle interactions are highly dependent on both their
   size and their surface chemistry and interesting research is being done
   with the interaction of particle characteristics and effect on
   thrombosis and the cardiovascular system. There is significant
   uncertainty surrounding some of the findings in this field as research
   in this area is still maturing. There are undoubtedly more physiological
   consequences than we are currently aware of resulting from environmental
   plastic exposure and more studies need to be conducted to reveal the
   full extent of pathologies caused by the various routes of microplastic
   exposure, with particular emphasis on longitudinal exposure effects.
   Further research will allow us to recognize the full extent of
   physiological impact and begin developing viable solutions to reduce
   plastic pollution and potentially design interventions to mitigate
   invivo plastic effects following significant or prolonged exposure.},

Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {302},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The tremendous use of plastic products to averse the infection rate
   during Covid-19 pandemic has developed great pressure on the management
   and disposal systems of plastic waste. The compulsory use of face masks
   to curb the infection and prevent transmission of the virus has led to
   addition of millions of face masks into the terrestrial and marine
   environment. The current study attempts to assess and quantify the rate
   of infection in coherence with the annual usage of face masks in various
   nations across the globe. The ecological footprint of the plastic waste
   generated from used and discarded face masks along with their potential
   impacts have also been discussed. The current study has quantified the
   total annual face masks across thirty-six nations to be more than 1.5
   million ton. The total estimated figure for annual plastic waste and
   microplastics in all these nations was \~{}4.2 million tonnes and 9774
   thousand tonnes, which emerges as a great threat to the global efforts
   towards reduction of plastic usage. The emergence of Covid-19 pandemic
   has modified the living habits with new enterprises being set up for
   Covid essential products, but the associated hazard of these products
   has been significantly ignored. Hence this study attempts to present a
   quantitative baseline database towards interpretation and understanding
   of the hazards associated with microplastics and increased dependence on
   plastic products.},

Title = {Study on the Direct Transformation of Milk Bottle and Wood into
   Wood-Plastic Composite through Injection Molding},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Plastic has transformed the world; however, it generates a huge amount
   of waste plastics. It is well evident that, if urgent action is not
   undertaken on plastic pollution, it will pose threats to not only the
   environment, but also human life. Just simply discarding waste plastics
   will result in wasting a lot of valuable materials that could be
   recycled. Recently, the use of waste plastics has been considered for
   producing wood plastic composites (WPCs), which are superior to normal
   wood. Waste plastics are pelletized using an extruder and are then
   subjected to injection molding. In this study, investigations were
   carried out to determine the possibility of producing WPCs without the
   palletization of waste plastic to turn WPC production into a shorter,
   simple, and easy-to-achieve process. Here, a waste milk bottle, a
   familiar single-use plastic, was picked as a case study. Waste plastic
   granules and wood particles were mixed and directly injection molded to
   produce valuable WPCs. The water absorption of WPCs with 20\% wood is
   0.35\%, and this increased to 0.37\% when wood content was increased to
   40\%. The tensile strength at yield, elongation at break, and impact
   strength of WPCs with 20\% wood content are 19.54 MPa, 5.21\%, and 33.92
   KJ/m(2), respectively, whereas it was 17.23 MPa, 4.05\%, and 26.61
   KJ/m(2) for the WPCs with 40\% wood content. This process can be a
   potential solution for two problematic wastes at the same time.},

Title = {The Relevance of Recyclability for the Life Cycle Assessment of
   Packaging Based on Design for Life Cycle},

Abstract = {The awareness for more environmentally sustainable packaging solutions
   is steadily growing. With both consumers and manufacturers looking to
   minimize their impacts on the environment, the need for
   easy-to-implement and standardized measures strengthening a circular
   economy rises. In the research, the goal was to determine whether the
   carbon footprint and circularity of non-food plastic packaging can be
   improved by simple design changes. The results should then lead to
   design recommendations, providing a Design for Life Cycle approach. The
   methodology of the study was to conceptually design a single-use plastic
   packaging with attributes having positive and negative effects on
   recyclability. Herein, only design characteristics from products
   obtainable on the market were regarded. Moreover, a comparison over
   existing recyclability assessment methods is given. The recyclability
   was then determined with the selected approach by Cyclos HTP, and a
   reference calculation was conducted. Life Cycle Assessments were
   implemented for 14 packaging designs using the GaBi software and the
   Environmental Footprint method. The results showed that dark color,
   material compounds, insoluble adhesives, and large labels result in
   lower recyclability of the single-use packaging. The impacts on climate
   change range from 0.13 kg CO2-equivalent emissions (100\% recyclability)
   to 0.21 kg CO2-equivalent emissions (0\% recyclability) per packaging,
   showing that lower recyclability leads to a larger carbon footprint in
   all assessed scenarios. Concluding, the research demonstrated that by
   applying Design for Life Cycle measures, impacts on climate change can
   be reduced. Lastly, design recommendations for decision makers are
   outlined.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the use of disposable plastics,
   including medical masks, which have become a necessity in our daily
   lives. As these are often improperly disposed of, they represent an
   important potential source of microplastics in the environment. We
   prepared microplastics from polypropylene medical masks and
   characterised their size, shape, organic chemical leaching, and acute
   toxicity to the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna. The three layers of
   the masks were separately milled and characterised. Each of the inner
   frontal, middle filtering, and outer layers yielded different types of
   microplastics: fibres were obtained from the inner and outer layer, but
   irregular fragments from the middle layer. The shape of the obtained
   microplastics differed from the initial fibrous structure of the intact
   medical mask layers, which indicates that the material is deformed
   during cryo-milling. The chemical compositions of plastics-associated
   chemicals also varied between the different layers. Typically, the inner
   layer contained more chemicals related to antimicrobial function and
   flavouring. The other two layers also contained antioxidants and their
   degradation products, plasticisers, cross-linking agents, antistatic
   agents, lubricants, and non-ionic surfactants. An acute study with D.
   magna showed that these microplastics do not cause immobility but do
   physically interact with the daphnids. Further long-term studies with
   these microplastics are needed using a suite of test organisms. Indeed,
   studies with other polypropylene microplastics have shown numerous
   adverse effects on other organisms at concentrations that have already
   been reported in the environment. Further efforts should be made to
   investigate the environmental hazards of polypropylene microplastics
   from medical masks and how to handle this new source of environmental
   burden.},

Title = {An urgent call to think globally and act locally on landfill disposable
   plastics under and after covid-19 pandemic: Pollution prevention and
   technological (Bio) remediation solutions},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Landfilling and illegal waste disposal have risen to deal with the
   COVID-19 potentially infectious waste, particularly in developing
   countries, which aggravates plastic pollution and inherent environmental
   threats to human and animal health. It is estimated that 3.5 million
   metric tonnes of masks (equivalent to 601 TIR containers) have been
   landfilled worldwide in the first year, with the potential to increase
   global plastic municipal solid waste by 3.5\%, alter biogas composition,
   and release 2.3 x 1021 microplastics to leachates or adjacent
   environments, in the coming years. This paper reviews the challenges
   raised in the pandemic scenario on landfills and discusses the potential
   environmental and health implications that might drive us apart from the
   2030 U.N. sustainable goals. Also, it highlights some innovative
   technologies to improve waste management (from collection to disposal,
   waste reduction, sterilization) and mitigates plastic leakage (emission
   control approaches, application of biotechnological and
   monitoring/computational tools) that can pave the way to environmental
   recovery. COVID-19 will eventually subside, but if no action is taken in
   the short-term towards effective plastic policies, replacement of
   plastics for sustainable alternatives (e.g., biobased plastics),
   improvement of waste management streams (prioritising flexible and
   decentralized approaches), and a greater awareness and responsibility of
   the general public, stakeholders, industries; we will soon reach a
   tipping-point in natural environments worldwide.},

Title = {Plastic accumulation during COVID-19: call for another pandemic;
   bioplastic a step towards this challenge?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution has become a serious transboundary challenge to nature
   and human health, with estimation of reports published - predicting a
   twofold increase in plastic waste by 2030. However, due to the COVID-19
   pandemic, the excessive use of single-use plastics (including face
   masks, gloves and personal protective equipment) would possibly
   exacerbate such forecasts. The transition towards eco-friendly
   alternatives like bio-based plastics and new emerging sustainable
   technologies would be vital to deal with future pandemics, even though
   the use or consumption of plastics has greatly enhanced our quality of
   life; it is however critical to move towards bioplastics. We cannot deny
   the fact that bioplastics have some challenges and shortcomings, but
   still, it is an ideal option for opt. The circular economy is the need
   of the hour for waste management. Along with all these practices,
   individual accountability, corporate intervention and government policy
   are also needed to prevent us from moving from one crisis to the next.
   Only through cumulative efforts, we will be able to cope up with this
   problem. This article collected scattered information and data about
   accumulation of plastic during COVID-19 worldwide. Additionally, this
   paper illustrates the substitution of petroleum-based plastics with
   bio-based plastics. Different aspects are discussed, ranging from
   advantages to challenges in the way of bioplastics.},

Title = {The High Cost of the Low-Cost Polybag System: A Review of Nursery
   Seedling Production Systems},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {An important strategy for meeting global landscape restoration goals is
   nursery production of high-quality seedlings. Growing seedlings with
   attributes that promote post-planting survival and growth can be
   dramatically influenced by the nursery container system. In many
   countries, nurseries produce seedlings in polybags filled with excavated
   soil. These seedlings often develop deformed roots with limited
   fibrosity which can lead to poor survival and growth after outplanting.
   Polybags are initially inexpensive but using these single-use plastic
   containers accrues expenses that are often untracked. Comparisons among
   nursery production systems must account for factors such as container
   longevity, labor efficiency, and seedling field performance. A more
   holistic approach to account for environmental, economic, social,
   logistic, and cultural elements in the cost-benefit equation that
   influences nursery production systems is needed. Converting to a modern
   container system requires concomitant adjustments in nursery scheduling
   and culturing matched to the new stock type. Doing so provides an
   opportunity to align nursery production techniques and resulting
   seedling attributes with anticipated field conditions. This article
   describes and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of nursery
   production systems and provides recommendations and case studies to aid
   nurseries in improving seedling quality toward meeting restoration goals
   in a cost-effective and timely manner.},

Abstract = {The novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an
   exceptional drift of production, utilization, and disposal of personal
   protective equipment (PPE) and different microplastic objects for safety
   against the virus. Hence, we reviewed related literature on severe acute
   respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detected from
   household, biomedical waste, and sewage to identify possible health
   risks and status of existing laws, regulations, and policies regarding
   waste disposal in South Asian (SA) countries. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA was
   detected in sewage and wastewater samples of Nepal, India, Pakistan, and
   Bangladesh. Besides, this review reiterates the enormous amounts of PPE
   and other single-use plastic wastes generated from healthcare facilities
   and households in the SA region with inappropriate disposal,
   landfilling, and/or incineration techniques wind-up polluting the
   environment. Consequently, the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) of SARS-CoV-2
   has been detected in sewer treatment plant in India. Moreover, the
   overuse of non-biodegradable plastics during the pandemic is
   deteriorating plastic pollution condition and causes a substantial
   health risk to the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. We recommend
   making necessary adjustments, adopting measures and strategies, and
   enforcement of the existing biomedical waste management and
   sanitation-related policy in SA countries. We propose to adopt the
   knowledge gaps to improve COVID-19-associated waste management and
   legislation to prevent further environmental pollution. Besides, the
   citizens should follow proper disposal procedures of COVID-19 waste to
   control the environmental pollution.},

Abstract = {Background Up to 30\% of urine samples from women with suspected urinary
   tract infection (UTI) are contaminated and need to be repeated,
   burdening health services and delaying antibiotic prescription. To
   prevent contamination, midstream urine (MSU) sampling, which can be
   difficult to achieve, is recommended. Urine collection devices (UCDs)
   that automatically capture MSU have been proposed as a solution. There
   are few studies exploring women's experiences of using such devices. Aim
   To explore women's experiences of urine collection and the use of UCDs
   during a suspected UTI. Design and setting An embedded qualitative study
   in a UK randomised controlled trial (RCT) of UCDs among women attending
   primary care for UTI symptoms. Method Semi-structured telephone
   interviews with 29 women who had participated in the RCT were conducted.
   The transcribed interviews were then thematically analysed. Results Most
   of the women were dissatisfied with how they normally produced urine
   samples. Many were able to use the devices, found them hygienic, and
   would use them again, even if they had initially experienced problems.
   Women who had not used the devices expressed interest in trying them.
   Potential barriers to UCD use included positioning for the sample, UTI
   symptoms making urine collection difficult, and waste disposal because
   of the single-use plastic in the UCDs. Conclusion Most women agreed
   there was a need for a user-and environmentally-friendly device to
   improve urine collection. Although using UCDs can be difficult for women
   experiencing UTI symptoms, they may be appropriate for asymptomatic
   sampling in other clinical populations.},

Title = {Exploring the effects of energy transition on the industrial value
   chains and alternative resources: A case study from the German federal
   state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW)},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Defossilizing the energy and industrial systems and transformation
   towards a circular economy have versatile impacts on the availability
   and demand of alternative resources. However, systematic analyses on
   these interrelations are very sparse. Thus, this paper investigates the
   interlinkages between the energy transition and the transformation
   towards a circular economy in Germany. The study is based on material
   flow analysis models of the steel and cement industries as well as the
   coal and lignite power plants in order to depict a comprehensive
   description of the material, energy and emission flows of these sectors
   and their interdependencies.
   The analyses prove the inherent interrelation between energy transition
   and circular economy. On the one hand, energy transition does not only
   bear various techno-economic challenges and have substantial effects on
   the production costs, but it also affects the availability of secondary
   materials. For instance, the coal phase-out and the introduction of
   green steel imply that the current supplies of blast furnace slag, fly
   ash and FGD gypsum cannot be maintained.
   On the other hand, circularity approaches can also influence the energy
   transition. For example, banning single-use plastics and increasing
   recycling rates of plastics can deprive the cement industry from
   significant amounts of energy resources with low-carbon footprint.
   Contrariwise, CO2 recycling can promote the energy transition by means
   of mitigating CO2 emissions via carbonation. Therefore, the study can
   help policymakers to understand the indirect effects of existing and
   future policies. Also, it can help to develop future strategies to
   handle associated impacts and avoid material shortages.},

Abstract = {Plastic industry is ubiquitous worldwide, and the generation of
   ``plastic waste{''} has been steadily increasing to the point of being
   considered a high impact pollutant. The expanded polystyrene (EPS)
   plastic industry aware of the issue is interested on trying recycling
   post-consumer material. Through a recent study made in an alliance
   between the private sector and the academy, the feasibility of the EPS
   ``mechanical{''} recycling was proven; therefore, a possible solution
   through a circular economy model. The aim of the present paper was to
   investigate the potential environmental impacts avoided by the circular
   economy scenario previously developed, through a life cycle assessment
   (LCA) performed for the city of Guayaquil, where 64\% of all the plastic
   manufacturing industries in the country are located. The entire life
   cycle of 1.00 kg of 5 x 5 inch. food containers were assessed from the
   production stage until its end-of-life stage: focusing on three
   different valorization paths, circular economy closed-loop
   (container-to-container) proposal with electricity share of 2019 and
   another with the 2027 future one, and traditional linear economy
   (container-to-landfill). Results showed that the scenario C that
   considers the recycling of post-consumer EPS waste and the electricity
   share proposed for 2027 have lower impacts in 14 out of 16 categories,
   in specific for the Land use (-31\%), Ozone Depletion (-28\%),
   Acidification (-24\%) and Terrestrial and Marine Eutrophication (-21\%).
   These results strongly suggest that the recycling of these kind of
   plastic waste could benefit the environment greatly. (C) 2022 The

Title = {Governance Strategies for Mitigating Microplastic Pollution in the
   Marine Environment: A Review},
Journal = {MICROPLASTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Pages = {15-46},

Abstract = {Threats emerging from microplastic pollution in the marine environment
   have received much global attention. This review assessed sources, fate,
   and impacts of microplastics in marine ecosystems and identified gaps.
   Most studies document the ubiquity of microplastics and associated
   environmental effects. Effects include impacts to marine ecosystems,
   risks to biodiversity, and threats to human health. Microplastic leakage
   into marine ecosystems arises from plastic waste mismanagement and a
   lack of effective mitigative strategies. This review identified a
   scarcity of microplastics' mitigation strategies from different
   stakeholders. Lack of community involvement in microplastic monitoring
   or ecosystem conservation exists due to limited existence of citizen
   science and stakeholder co-management initiatives. Although some
   management strategies exist for controlling effects of microplastics
   (often implemented by local and global environmental groups), a
   standardized management strategy to mitigate microplastics in coastal
   areas is urgently required. There is a need to review policy
   interventions aimed at plastic reduction in or near coastal ecosystems
   and evaluate their effectiveness. There is also a need to identify focal
   causes of microplastic pollution in the marine environment through
   further environmental research and governance approaches. These would
   extend to creating more effective policies as well as harmonized and
   extended efforts of educational campaigns and incentives for plastic
   waste reduction while mandating stringent penalties to help reduce
   microplastic leakage into the marine environment.},

Title = {Advancing mechanical recycling of multilayer plastics through finite
   element modelling and environmental policy},

Volume = {166},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Plastics are attracting negative publicity due to the scale of current
   pollution levels, yet they are irreplaceable in several applications
   such as food packaging, where different types of plastics are combined
   in laminate form to produce multilayered packaging (MLP) materials which
   extend the life of food items packaged within them. Increased plastic
   recycling is urgently needed, however for MLP it is particularly
   difficult. For the first time, this study combines engineering tools
   with environmental policy towards developing solutions for current
   single use plastic packaging. This study investigates recycling
   challenges for MLP and emerging melt-blending based mechanical recycling
   solutions as this is the main current method for material recovery of
   conventional plastics. Melt-blending of MLP with compatibilisers is
   explored, and the current lack of models addressing the influence of
   compatibilisers is identified. This gap in knowledge is addressed using
   novel engineering models based on the finite element (FE)
   micromechanical modelling technique to estimate the mechanical
   properties of recycled blends. Our model output is compared with
   experimental data available in literature and the good agreement
   highlights its predictive ability, providing a fast and cost-effective
   novel method for optimising recycled plastics. The policy aspect
   proposes the introduction of twenty policies based on mission-orientated
   innovation strategy to enable deployment of the recycling technologies
   studied whilst improving the viability of recycling of material
   currently not recycled. Implementation of these measures by the
   stakeholders will enable adoption of new MLP recycling techniques,
   create demand for recycled materials from MLP and incentivise MLP
   collection to mitigate pollution.},

Title = {The paradigm in conversion of plastic waste into value added materials},
Journal = {CLEANER ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The global proliferation of plastic waste is a dire concern as fumble
   wastes in the environment degrade plastics into smaller fragments that
   pose a prodigious menace to biota. Plastics are persistent due to their
   inherent properties which have found omnipresent applications in
   automotive, electronics, energy, adhesives, household components,
   paints, coatings, and the myriad of medical fields, etc. Nevertheless,
   plastics have a caliginous side. However, plausible methods and cogent
   techniques to deal with emerging plastic wastes have not been
   established which results in the amalgamation of waste creating havoc.
   The cognizance of fostering and sharing of actual management of plastic
   wastes involving harmonization of specific standards and practices could
   assist inappropriate management of plastic wastes. Moreover, the
   conversion of plastic waste into a gamut of applications such as energy
   recovery, components of building construction, production of
   nanomaterials, evolve novel monomers, etc could be a propitious endeavor
   for mankind. Nevertheless, the diminution of ubiquitous concern should
   headway from the end-of-pipe approach to pre-emptive strategies by
   utilizing the plastic wastes into intrinsic applications or by
   eradicating the single-use plastics. This exploration will proffer a
   vision in the conversion of waste into gimmick applications useful for
   mankind and to contemplate whether recycling is the only magic bullet or
   we could utilize it head-on.},

Abstract = {This study examines how different ways of presenting information about
   the ecological threats stemming from the use of disposable plastics may
   affect people's willingness to reduce their use. To test our hypotheses,
   we used a 2 x 3 x 2 between-subjects experimental design, utilizing a
   sample of 1001 Hong Kong residents. The independent variables tested
   included: (a) message frame (gain vs. loss), (b) modality (text vs.
   image vs. infographic), and (c) information source (government vs.
   non-governmental organization). The findings demonstrate that the loss
   frame was more effective than the gain frame in persuading participants
   to reduce the use of disposable plastics. Furthermore, compared to
   image-based messages, text-based and infographic-based messages were
   more effective in promoting the reduction in the use of disposable
   plastics. For information sources, however, we found no main effect on
   behavioral intentions. However, this study still suggests an interaction
   effect of the loss frame and NGO source, as well as the interaction
   between text-based modality and government source, both leading to more
   positive outcomes. Furthermore, the study reveals that negative
   emotional responses mediate the effect of media frames on behavioral
   intentions. The findings offer useful insights for designing more
   effective communication campaigns aimed at curbing the use of disposable
   plastics.},

Title = {Microparticles and microplastics released from daily use of plastic
   feeding and water bottles and plastic injectors: potential risks to
   infants and children in China},

Abstract = {Daily use of plastic feeding and water bottles occur widely in China,
   and they could be sources for release of microplastics (MPs), which
   threaten the health of Chinese infants and children during daily usage.
   In this work, we investigated the use of polycarbonate (PC) and
   polypropylene (PP) for making water bottles (WBs) and polyphenylene
   sulfone resins (PPSU) for making feeding bottles (FBs), and we found
   that feeding bottles and water bottles released microparticles in
   amounts ranging from 53 to 393 particles/mL during 100 opening/closing
   cycles. The good linear regressions for plots of microparticles released
   vs. abrasion distance (r(2) = 0.811) indicated that thick-necked bottles
   release more microparticles than thin-necked bottles. The brands and
   types of bottles (plastic vs. glass) influence microparticle release,
   and this indicates that high-quality plastic and glass bottles release
   fewer microparticles and are good for the health of infants and
   children. In addition to calcium stearate and silicone additives, the
   identified MPs account for 7.5 to 42.1\% of released microparticles with
   different polymer types, sizes (from 20 to 500 mu m) and shapes (cubic,
   spherical and irregular shapes). Additionally, an average of 1.74 MPs
   were released from an injection with a single-use plastic injector.
   Nevertheless, a number of microparticles and nanosized plastics were
   observed with all samples, suggesting that the health risks of micro-
   and nanosized particles to humans, especially babies and children, and
   the environment should be considered seriously.},

Abstract = {The plastic bottles that are used for packaging water are harmful to the
   environment. The objective of this study was to examine the influence of
   consumers' environmental concern on both their intention to reduce
   consumption of water sold in single-use plastic bottles and their actual
   behaviour. An extended version of the theory of planned behaviour is
   used as the main theoretical framework. Structural equation modelling is
   employed based on data gathered in 2020 from 1011 Polish respondents to
   test the study's hypotheses. The results support the model, as all
   tested relations are statistically significant. More specifically, we
   confirm the indirect impact of environmental concern on both intention
   and behaviour concerning bottled water consumption (BWC): environmental
   concern is positively related to attitudes towards reducing BWC,
   subjective norms regarding reduction in BWC, perceived behavioural
   control over BWC, and perceived moral obligation to protect natural
   resources, all of which, in turn, are positively related to intention to
   reduce BWC. We also prove that intention to reduce BWC is positively
   related to consumption of non-bottled water. The results may serve to
   guide decision makers seeking to promote ecologically friendly
   behaviour.},

Title = {Personal protective equipment (PPE) pollution driven by the COVID-19
   pandemic along the shoreline of Lake Tana, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {Personal protective equipment (PPE) pollution has become one of the most
   pending environmental challenges result-ing from the pandemic. While
   various studies investigated PPE pollution in the marine environment,
   freshwater bodies have been largely overlooked. In the present study,
   PPE monitoring was carried out in the vicinity of Lake Tana, the largest
   lake in Ethiopia. PPE density, types, and chemical composition (FTIR
   spectroscopy) were reported. A total of 221 PPEs were identified with a
   density ranging from 1.22 x 10(-5) PPE m(-2) (control site S1) to 2.88x
   10(-4) PPE m(-2) with a mean density of 1.54 x 10(-4) +/- 2.58 x 10(-5)
   PPE m(-2). Mismanaged PPE waste was found in all the sam-pling sites,
   mostly consisting of surgical face masks (93.7\%). Statistical analyzes
   revealed significantly higher PPE den-sities in sites where several
   recreational, touristic, and commercial activities take place, thus,
   revealing the main sources of PPE pollution. Furthermore, polypropylene
   and polyester fabrics were identified as the main components of surgical
   and reusable cloth masks, respectively. Given the hazard that PPEs
   represent to aquatic biota (e.g., entanglement, ingestion) and their
   ability to release microplastics (MPs), it is necessary to implement
   sufficient solid waste management plans and infrastructure where lake
   activities take place. Additionally, local authorities must promote and
   ensure sustainable tourism in order to maintain the ecosystems in Lake
   Tana. Prospective research prior-ities regarding the colonization and
   degradation of PPE, as well as the release of toxic chemicals, were
   identified and discussed.},

Title = {Plastics are a new threat to Palau's coral reefs},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {7},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution of the oceans has long been an ongoing and growing
   problem. Single-use plastic (plastic bags and microbeads) is responsible
   for most of this pollution. In recent years, studies have highlighted
   the importance of the size of plastic particles, and the impact of this
   pollution source on the environment. We determined the concentration of
   small marine plastics in seawater, sediments and beach sand around a
   pristine reef area (Republic of Palau) using very simple tools (plankton
   net, sieves, organic matter degradation, density separation, Nile red
   fluorochrome). In this study, we succeeded in detecting microplastic
   (MPs) particles and microplastic fibers, but also nanoplastic (NPs).
   These three types of particles were found in all samples with a large
   heterogeneity, from 0.01 to 0.09 particles L-1 and 0.17 to 32.13
   particles g-1 DW for MPs in seawater, sediments and sand, respectively.
   Even when NPs were identified, the amounts of NPs were underestimated
   and varied from 0.09 to 0.43 particles L-1 in seawater and from 1.08 to
   71.02 particles g(-1) DW in sediment and sand, respectively. These
   variations could be attributed to the environmental characteristics of
   the different sites. This study shows that plastic pollution must be
   considered in environmental studies even in the most pristine locations.
   It also shows that NPs pollution is related to the amount of MPs found
   at the sites. To understand the effects of this plastic pollution, it is
   necessary that the next toxicological studies take into account the
   effects of this fraction that makes up the NPs.},

Title = {From city to sea: Spatiotemporal dynamics of floating macrolitter in the
   Tiber River},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Rivers are undoubtedly the main pathway of waste dispersed in the
   environment that from land reaches oceans and seas increasing the amount
   of marine litter. Major cities are a great source of riverine litter as
   large urbanization can originate pressure on the integrated waste
   management resulting in litter entering the rivers. Within this study,
   we aim to investigate the dynamic of floating riverine macrolitter
   (items >2.5 cm) in the city of Rome before it reaches the sea by
   assessing the composition, amount, and seasonal trends of litter
   transported from the urban centre to the main river mouth of Tiber
   River. Visual surveys for a whole year (March 2021-February 2022) were
   conducted from two bridges, Scienza Bridge (in the city) and Scafa
   Bridge (at the main river mouth) and followed JRC/RIMMEL protocol for
   riverine litter monitoring. Overall, similar litter composition was
   observed from the city centre to the mouth with a prevalence of plastic
   material, mainly related to fragmentation process (i.e. plastic pieces)
   and single use items, mainly in food and beverage sectors. An
   extrapolated annual loading of 4 x 105 items/year was estimated at the
   main mouth of Tiber River. The litter flux seems to be influenced by the
   seasonal variability and hydrometeoro-logical parameters. The frequency
   of size classes decreases with increasing size in both sites, and more
   than half of the recorded items were below 10 cm. Specific categories
   belonging to ``other plastics{''} have been reported related to
   anti-Covid-19 behaviour such as face masks and beverage sector, e.g.
   bottle lids and rings. The main colour of plastics was white, suggesting
   weathering process of floating riverine litter. This study contributes
   to increasing knowledge of the origin, composition and spatiotemporal
   dynamics of riverine floating litter from the city and entering the sea.},

Abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, different strategies emerged to combat
   shortages of certified face masks used in the healthcare sector. These
   strategies included increasing production from the original
   manufacturing sites, commissioning new production facilities locally,
   exploring and allowing the reuse of single-use face masks via various
   decontamination methods, and developing reusable mask alternatives that
   meet the health and safety re-quirements set out in European Standards.
   In this article, we quantify and evaluate the life-cycle environmental
   impacts of selected mask options available for use by healthcare workers
   in the UK, with the objective of supporting decision-and policy-making.
   We investigate alternatives to traditional single-use face masks like
   sur-gical masks and respirators (or FFP3 masks), including cloth masks
   decontaminated in washing machines; FFP3 masks decontaminated via vapour
   hydrogen peroxide, and rigid half masks cleaned with antibacterial
   wipes. Our analysis demonstrates that: (1) the reuse options analysed
   are environmentally preferential to the traditional ``use then
   dispose{''} of masks; (2) the environmental benefits increase with the
   number of reuses; and (3) the manufacturing location and the material
   composition of the masks have great influence over the life-cycle
   envi-ronmental impacts of each mask use option, in particular for
   single-use options.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Title = {Should We Ban Single-Use Plastics? A Role-Playing Game to Argue and Make
   Decisions in a Grade-8 School Chemistry Class},

Abstract = {The social dimension of chemistry is relevant and present in numerous
   socioscientific issues, for example, the use of plastics. These issues
   can be covered at school by implementing strategies such as
   role-playing, which allow different perspectives to be understood,
   thereby helping to promote changes in attitude. This paper presents a
   pilotstudy about the design and results obtained in the role-playing
   game ``Should we ban singleuse plastics?{''}, which covers the problem
   of plastics in a secondary school chemistry class by way of
   argumentation and decision making. Role-playing allows students to
   represent the viewpoints of different important actors in this area both
   in favor of a ban on their use (fisherman, environmental scientist,
   teenager, biodegradable material manufacturer) and against (manufacturer
   of disposable surgical products, teenager, worker in a plastic cutlery
   factory, director of an oil company). This role-playing was implemented
   virtually for a class of grade-8 school students (secondary schoolers in
   Spain). The main findings include the promotion of learning about the
   chemical aspects of plastics and the change in attitude of some students
   regarding this issue after preparing and using arguments and
   counterarguments based on scientific evidence in a debate. Role-playing
   is well received by students and helps them to experience positive
   emotions. Students were found to be very critical of the issue
   addressed, and the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to affect their decisions.},

Abstract = {A global pandemic and climate change concerns marked the start of the
   3(rd) decade in the 21(st) century. The overall impact of 2020 pandemic
   has significantly changed the labour market, which meant working from
   home for a large number of employees both in the public and private
   sectors worldwide. It became clear that the labour market changes were
   going to be more permanent and have longer impact than it was expected
   at first. Companies and employees have been adapting to the new
   situation with varying success. Flexibility, lower costs, and work-life
   balance are evident benefits of remote work but working from home can
   also make a notable effect on the environment. This potential positive
   environmental effect can be observed in the context of strengthening the
   response to the threat of climate change. Record atmospheric greenhouse
   gas concentrations and consequent global warming will have long-lasting
   repercussions for the total world population according to the World
   Meteorological Organization (WMO). Besides greenhouse gas emissions and
   global heating, the environment is troubled with general energy
   consumption, paper, and plastic consumption. The objective of this paper
   is to find possibilities to make positive effects on climate change by
   moving from traditional work in offices to work from home. The first
   premise in working from home is less commuting, which means less
   greenhouse gas emissions. Lesser power consumption can be considered as
   the second advantage of remote working. According to the World Economic
   Forum, the power consumption has gone down from the COVID-19 pandemic,
   even though the level of reduction was not as high as expected. In 2020,
   paper production went over 350 million tons using more than 42\% of cut
   trees. Remote work means digitizing documents and less paper usage on a
   global level. Paperless work can also have a positive effect on cutting
   greenhouse gas emissions substantially because one saved tree can remove
   up to 6.67 kilograms of carbon dioxide from the air. Reducing plastic
   consumption is not directly connected to remote working, but half of the
   plastic produced on a global level is single-use plastic, and working
   from home can cut the use of plastic in offices. In conclusion, remote
   working can be a step in the right direction in fighting climate change.},

Abstract = {Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have garnered global attention to replace
   petroleum-based plastics in certain applications due to their
   biodegradability and sustainability. Among the different types of PHAs,
   poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) {[}P(3HB-co-3HHx)]
   copolymer has similar properties to commodity plastics, making them a
   suitable candidate to replace certain types of single-use plastics,
   medical devices, and packaging materials. The degradation rate of
   P(3HB-co-3HHx) is faster than the commercial petroleum-based plastics
   which take a very long time to be degraded, causing harmful pollution to
   both land and marine ecosystem. The biodegradability of the
   P(3HB-co-3HHx) is also dependent on its 3HHx molar composition which in
   turn influences the crystallinity of the material. Various metabolic
   pathways like the common PHA biosynthesis pathway, which involves phaA,
   phaB, and phaC, beta-oxidation, and fatty acids de novo synthesis are
   used by bacteria to produce PHA from different carbon sources like fatty
   acids and sugars, respectively. There are various factors affecting the
   3HHx molar composition of P(3HB-co-3HHx), like PhaCs, the engineering of
   PhaCs, and the metabolic engineering of strains. It is crucial to
   control the 3HHx molar composition in the P(3HB-co-3HHx) as it will
   affect its properties and applications in different fields.},

Title = {Utilisation of natural wastes: Water-resistant semi-transparent paper
   for food packaging},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Use of non-degradable plastics in food packaging is alarming for the
   environment as they are often thrown away after short consumption.
   Though papers are replacing plastics in different sectors, their low
   water resistance limits their use in food packaging. in the past,
   water-resistant papers have been fabricated, but the natural
   degradability of the paper has been compensated. This study proposes
   water-resistant yet biodegradable papers from naturally abundant wastes,
   such as banana plant (BP) and water hyacinth (WH) and validates their
   properties for practical packaging uses. The resources were completely
   used, avoiding generation of any inprocess biomass residue. This study
   for the first time reports the impact of ethyl cellulose (EC) coating
   (\~{}10 mu m) on paper surfaces. The morphology and chemical analysis of
   the coated papers confirmed the consistent formation of EC layer on
   paper surfaces. The presence of EC significantly reduced the vapour
   transmission (22-30\%) and moisture content (6-11\%) of the papers.
   Water drops were stable on the coated surfaces at least for 20 min and
   then were wiped off leaving a dry surface. EC coating considerably
   increased the tensile index, i. e., 13-17\% for BP and 20-35\% for WH,
   though elongation and modulus properties remained almost unchanged. All
   the papers showed ultraviolet (UV)-resistance, while the coated papers
   were more transparent in the visible light region. Overall results
   confirmed the potential of the proposed EC-coated papers as a promising
   alternative to single-use plastics in food packaging.},

Title = {The plastic waste problem in Malaysia: management, recycling and
   disposal of local and global plastic waste},
Journal = {SN APPLIED SCIENCES},

Abstract = {Plastic waste is one of the world's most pressing human health and
   environmental concerns. Plastic constitutes the third highest waste
   source globally, with the total volume of plastic waste growing in-line
   with increases in the global population and per capita consumption.
   Malaysia is tracking global trends in both the overall generation of
   plastic waste and the consumption of single-use plastics and since 2017
   has been the world's largest importer of plastic waste. These elements
   create a number of major challenges for the country's waste management
   system. This review outlines the current state of plastic waste
   production and management in Malaysia, including options for landfill,
   recycling and incineration. It presents information on the scale and
   both the human and ecological risks of plastic waste in the country
   (i.e. microplastics, landfill, incineration), outlines key plastic waste
   management policy initiatives (including plastics alternatives such as
   biodegradable plastics) and highlights key constraints on the success of
   these. Significant internal constraints stem from the inconsistent
   application of policy initiatives by state governments, in addition to
   the lack of public awareness and interest in household recycling. The
   paper closes by discussing options for and constraints on the switch to
   biodegradable alternatives and proposes a model of plastic management
   based on a circular economy approach and solid waste management
   hierarchy. Success in reducing the problems posed by plastic in Malaysia
   will require sustained effort at many levels, but positive experiences
   in other countries give some cause for optimism.},

Abstract = {Plastics play an essential role in every area of the economy across the
   world due to their widespread usage in agriculture, architecture and
   construction, health, and consumer products. They are the foundation of
   many businesses since they are utilized in the production of a variety
   of commodities such as defense materials, sanitary wares, tiles, plastic
   bottles, fake leather, and a variety of other home items. Food
   packaging, pharmaceutical packaging, detergent packaging, and cosmetic
   packaging all employ plastics. Per year, almost one trillion single-use
   plastic bags are used across the world, or roughly two million every
   minute. Plastic pollution poses a severe danger to the planet's
   environment and human existence. The build-up of plastic on land and at
   water has sparked interest in degrading these polymers. As a result, in
   order to lessen the environmental impact of plastics, appropriate
   biodegradable technologies must be used. Microbes that can digest
   plastic waste, particularly non-biodegradable polymers like
   polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, and
   polyurethane, are one way to solve this problem. Many bacteria have the
   ability to break down plastics. However, while this biodegradation
   process is not fully efficient, it is a way forward from traditional
   plastic waste management. More research on microorganisms that digest
   polyvinyl chloride is needed since this type of polymer is the most
   difficult to decompose. This review focuses on the origins of plastics,
   strategies for managing plastic waste, and the biodegradation of plastic
   waste utilizing various microbes.},

Abstract = {A heterogeneous amount of waste of different origins is continuously
   generated along Italian coasts in the Mediterranean Sea. In this paper,
   using information regarding the quantities and the different types of
   marine litter based on Project AWARE's ``Dive Against Debris{''} data,
   we try to identify the main sources of this waste. In particular, the
   methodological approach used associates the origin of marine litter
   sources with the dataset of geo-localised state-owned maritime
   concessions, which are loaded by the granting bodies (regions,
   municipalities, port authorities) on the State Property Information
   System (Sid). The sources of marine litter were evaluated using the
   matrix scoring technique (MST). Then, to assess the weight of each
   source in each station, the community-level weighted mean (CWM) was
   calculated. Single-use plastic accounted for the highest percentage
   (19.13\%), followed by glass beverage bottles (10.90\%), shopping bags
   (9.03\%), aluminium beverage cans (4.91\%), and cigarette butts
   (4.61\%).
   Tourism and beach users contributed to 42.3\% of the litter found,
   followed by fishing (15.7\%) and yachting (11.3\%). The overlapping of
   the data collected by scuba divers with the state concessions of
   activities from offshore and mainland areas was used to distinguish the
   anthropic pressures that impact the coast. Policy makers and the local
   administrator may use these results to define new methods of collection
   and reuse of anthropic waste through a more harmonised approach in the
   management of marine waste.},

Abstract = {Microbial transmissions via membrane surface and single-use
   plastic-induced pollution are two urgent societal problems. This
   research introduces a scalable fabrication strategy for fully biobased
   antibacterial and ultraviolet-B block polylactic acid (PLA) films
   integrating natural coatings and nanopatterns via ultrasonic atomization
   spray coating and thermal nanoimprinting lithography (TNIL) techniques,
   respectively. Tannic acid (TA) and gallic acid (GA) were formulated
   prior to TNIL using anode aluminum oxide template. Results reveal that
   TA and GA inks display intense adsorption in the UVB region. Plasma
   increases the hydrophilicity of PLA films for fast spreading of ink
   droplets. Micron-sized pillars observed on film confirm the successful
   structural replication. TA-coated PLA films display higher transparency
   than GA-coated ones. Nanopatterned PLA films have a modest antibacterial
   resistance of c. 45\% against Escherichia coli. TA/GA coatings, however,
   impart PLA films with a bacterial reduction rate of over 80\%. The
   integration of a TA or GA coating with nanopatterns further promotes the
   antibacterial rate up to 98\%. The cytocompatibility of TA and GA
   demonstrates that the engineered film can potentially be applied as food
   packaging. Finally, a continuous mass production strategy is proposed
   along with an outline of the associated challenges and costs. This study
   provides a scalable strategy to the sustainable development of
   eco-benign and functional films.},

Title = {Economic Conditions to Circularize Clinical Plastics},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Over 5.5 million tons of plastic waste are generated globally from the
   research sectors. A university laboratory, e.g., pathology, can generate
   250 tons of clinical plastic waste annually. The UK National Health
   Service (NHS) generates 133 kilotons (kt) of clinical plastic waste
   annually. Healthcare facilities in the US generate 1.7 million tons of
   clinical plastic waste annually. In addition, 95\% of the clinical
   plastics are single-use plastics derived from fossil resources, i.e.,
   crude oils. These single-use clinical plastic wastes are incinerated,
   contributing to global warming, or go to the landfill, contributing to
   resource depletion. Plastic leakage is a major threat to the
   environment. This linear plastics economy model, take-make-dispose, must
   be replaced by a circular plastics economy, i.e., sort plastic wastes,
   wash, decontaminate, recover materials, blend with bio-based compounds
   as necessary and circulate recyclate plastics, for holistic systemic
   sustainability. While there are multi-faceted environmental drivers for
   a circular plastics economy, there are many uncertainties in the
   economic attributes, electricity price, labor cost and chemical cost
   being the primary ones influencing the cost of production of secondary
   or recyclate plastics, requiring government and policy support, such as
   a gate fee on plastic waste by the generators to the recyclers. An
   essential macroeconomic condition for techno-economically (or
   micro-economically) feasible plastic waste recycling is low oil and gas
   prices that influence the recyclate plastics and electricity prices. It
   is essential to de-fossilize the economy by decoupling renewable
   electricity generation from natural gas consumption and
   fossil-independent biopolymer productions displacing fossil-derived
   plastics to stimulate the circular economy. This study shows a
   comprehensive and robust technoeconomic analysis of mechanical recycling
   of clinical plastic wastes into secondary plastics recovery.},

Abstract = {With the mass production and consumption of single-use plastics and
   other plastic products, plastic waste management and its resulting
   microplastic pollution have become the most noteworthy environmental
   issues. The main objectives of this paper were to review the regulatory
   measures for plastic waste reduction and recycling, analyse the trend
   changes on the recycled amounts of regulated plastic containers and also
   address the discussions on the impacts of COVID-19 on the expected
   increase in plastic waste. In the past two decades, the central
   competent authority (i.e. Environmental Protection Administration (EPA))
   in Taiwan has promulgated some regulations governing plastic waste
   reduction and recycling, especially plastic containers. Based on the
   official statistics, it showed that total certified amounts of regulated
   plastic containers have increased from 45,552 tonnes in 1998 to 194,133
   tonnes in 2019. This shift was in line with circular economy policies by
   the Zero Waste Program and Resource Recycling and Reuse Plan launched by
   the Taiwan EPA during this period. On the other hand, the COVID-19
   pandemic will impact on the regulatory policies for plastic waste
   management because the excess use of regulated plastic products will be
   temporarily permitted due to the epidemic prevention and control
   measures. Although the increased proportion of plastic waste in
   municipal solid waste (MSW) will be beneficial for the energy
   efficiencies of waste-to-power systems in MSW incineration plants, the
   recycling and reduction rates of regulated plastic containers or
   products could decline during the COVID-19 breakout.},

Title = {Innovative Strategy to Reduce Single-Use Plastics in Sustainable
   Horticulture by a Refund Strategy for Flowerpots},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {(1) Background: Black plastics pose a general problem in sustainability
   issues, as the recycling is hampered by the black colour disguising the
   type of plastics in the NIR scanner on the garbage sorting belt, as the
   black colour absorbs NIR radiation. Sorting flower/plant pots suffer
   from their additional soil contamination in the strive for sustainable
   flower production in horticulture. As these black plastic flowerpots are
   currently rarely recycled, a study was instigated of reusing them based
   on Heino Schwarz's innovative idea. (2) Methods: In the first step, the
   carbon footprint was calculated for the flowerpots of two sizes employed
   in the nursery, their customised production from virgin polypropylene
   and the delivery from the Netherlands to the nursery in Bavaria. In step
   2, the carbon footprint was calculated based on PAS 2050-1 for the
   number of flowerpots in circulation and return rates in 2019 and in 2020
   to assess the GHG saved by the innovation. (3) Results: The innovative
   concept of Heino Schwarz is a discount on returning the customised used
   flowerpots, with a 40\% increase from 24,533 returned flowerpots in 2019
   to 39,797 in 2020. This shows the increasing acceptance and
   environmental awareness of the consumer and the great success. (4)
   Conclusions and outlook: The present case study has shown that
   innovative approaches such as discounts for reused/returned flowerpots
   of the Schwarz nursery can save 3.85-4.56 t CO2eq, a valuable
   contribution to reducing GHG emissions, creating environmental awareness
   among the consumers and building a close B2C relationship. The amount of
   CO2eq saved is equivalent to ca. 40\% of the annual carbon burden of a
   European/German citizen or ca. 23,000 km driven in a private vehicle,
   the average mileage driven privately in two years.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastic waste is gradually considered a potential material
   for circular economy. Ion exchange resin obtained from polystyrene waste
   by sulfonating with H2SO4 was used for heavy metal removal from
   electroplating wastewater. Batch mode experiments of Cu2+, Zn2+, and
   Cd2+ were carried out to determine effect of pH, initial concentration,
   equilibrium time, and the isotherm and kinetic parameters; the stability
   of the resin in continuous operation was then evaluated. Finally, the
   longevity of the resin after being exhausted was explored. The results
   indicated that at pH 6, a pseudo-second-order kinetic model was
   applicable to describe adsorption of studied heavy metals by sulfonated
   polystyrene with adsorption capacities of 7.48 mg Cu2+/g, 7.23 mg
   Zn2+/g, and 6.50 mg Cd2+/g, respectively. Moreover, the ion exchange
   process between sulfonated polystyrene resin and Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+ ions
   followed the Langmuir isotherm adsorption model with R-2 higher than
   96\%. The continuous fixed-bed column in conditions of a sulfonated
   polystyrene mass of 500 g, and a flow rate of 2.2 L/h was investigated
   for an influent solution with known initial concentration of 20 mg/L.
   Thomas and Yoon-Nelson models were tested with regression analysis. When
   being exhausted, the sulfonated polystyrene was regenerated by NaCl in
   10 min with ratio 5 mL of NaCl 2 M per 1 g saturated resins. After 4
   times regeneration, the heavy metal removal efficiency of sulfonated
   polystyrene was reduced to 50\%. These aforementioned results can figure
   out that by sulfonating polystyrene waste to synthesize ion exchanging
   materials, this method is technically efficient and environmentally
   friendly to achieve sustainability.},

Abstract = {Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles of water have experienced huge
   growth in demand and sales in South Africa. This expansion in use
   creates challenges as well as opportunities for managing the life cycle
   impact. The properties that make PET desirable for fluid-containing
   bottles have also made it highly resistant to environmental
   biodegradation. Reusable plastic bottles are now marketed as a solution
   to reduce the impact of single-use plastic bottles. We assessed the life
   cycle impact of single-use PET bottles and an alternative, reusable PET
   bottle based on consumption patterns in South Africa and the material
   flow and supply chain in the urban environment. This robust
   consideration of local conditions is important in evaluating the life
   cycle impact. In an examination of 13 impact categories, the reusable
   PET bottle had lower impact than the single-use bottle in all the impact
   categories examined. The mass of PET bottle material required to deliver
   the water needs at any given time is a dominant factor on the
   environmental burden. Extending the life of reusable bottles and
   designing lighter weight bottles would reduce their life cycle impact.
   Information obtained in evaluating alternatives to plastic water bottles
   can be valuable for providing a foundation assessment for policymakers
   and plastic bottle manufacturers to make informed choices and to focus
   on improvements in life cycle impact. Significance: center dot The
   significant impact of the production phase in the life cycle of both
   single-use and reusable PET bottles confirms the need to design a much
   more lightweight bottle to reduce the mass of materials used in
   production. center dot Another key consideration was the long
   transportation distance covered during the production phase, and the
   negative impact of current vehicular emissions. Municipalities and waste
   collectors should consider the use of low-carbon transport. center dot
   This study highlights the value of extending the life of plastic
   bottles, as well as recycling for material recovery, remanufacturing and
   repurposing these bottles within the City. center dot The use of fewer,
   larger single-use bottles compared with a greater number of smaller
   single-use bottles is discussed.},

Title = {Practice, benefits, and impact of personal protective equipment (PPE)
   during COVID-19 pandemic: Envisioning the UN sustainable development
   goals (SDGs) through the lens of clean water sanitation, life below

Abstract = {Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) highlights
   the global health emergency. To limit the rate of COVID-19 transmission
   to health care workers, adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) are
   required. Emerging reports indicate that the widespread usage of PPE
   during the COVID-19 outbreak has exacerbated plastic contamination in
   the ocean.
   Purpose: This paper attempts to understand the influence of practice,
   benefits, and impact of PPE during the COVID-19 crisis on clean water
   sanitation, life below water, and life on land (SDGs 6, 14, and 15
   respectively) in Fiji and assess the effectiveness of measurements taken
   to deal with this crisis. Fiji is a small Pacific Island Country (PIC)
   and the global crisis of COVID-19 entered the Fijian border on 19th,
   March 2020. The second wave of COVID-19 was reported on 18th, April
   2021, which began at a managed quarantine facility after contact between
   a couple returning from India to Fiji and a soldier. Since then the
   number of cases has been increasing daily and posing a risk to the
   public.
   Materials and method: A personal observation was made to collect the PPE
   pollution on the streets, near roads, car parks, markets, and towns.
   Results: Widespread PPE pollution was noticed, and the common PPE found
   on the Vesivesi road in Suva, Fiji were facemasks (61.36\%) and hand
   gloves (38.64\%), as it is mostly used by the public, police officers,
   municipal waste management, shopping malls workers, and medical care
   workers. Face shield littering was limited due to fewer users.
   Conclusions: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, this study stresses a
   great concern on enabling SDGs 6, 14, and 15 and how the use of PPE
   during this period has impacted the natural environment. It is critical
   to remember that managing PPE waste during a contagious pandemic should
   be treated as an emergency and handled quickly.},

Title = {Characterization of anthropogenic marine macro-debris affecting coral
   habitat in the highly urbanized seascape of Mumbai megacity},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},

Abstract = {Marine debris has become a major form of pollution and a serious
   ecosystem health concern. The present study evaluates the accumulation,
   origin, and fate of debris in intertidal coral habitats of Mumbai-one of
   the world's highly populated coastal cities on the west coast of India.
   Predominantly, seven hermatypic coral species belonging to seven genera
   and five families were identified and mainly represented by
   Pseudosidastrea, Porites, and Bernardpora. In terms of number, the mean
   density of marine debris was 1.60 +/- 0.13 SE items/m(2), which is
   higher than the global average. The mean density of plastic debris was
   1.46 +/- 0.14 SE items/m(2). Approximately 9\% of total coral colonies
   were in physical contact with debris, and 22\% of these colonies showed
   visible signs of partial bleaching. Single use plastic bags and wrappers
   were dominant plastic debris. The study area was characterized as `very
   poor cleanliness' according to the Beach Quality Indexes, which include
   the Clean Coast Index, General Index, and Hazardous Items Index. The
   numerical model indicates the influence of river discharge and probable
   areas of plastic accumulation with high tidal currents in this region,
   maneuvering the spatial advection of litter in the nearshore areas.
   Combined analysis of ground-truthing and model simulation implies that
   the possible contributing sources of litter were representatives of
   land-based and sea-originated. The overall results point to increasing
   anthropogenic stressors threatening coastal coral communities, including
   marine debris pollution. It is advocated to adopt an integrated coastal
   zone management approach supported by coordinated policy frameworks
   could guide the mitigation of the debris footprint in coastal
   environments.},

Title = {Do Social Media Posts Influence Consumption Behavior towards Plastic
   Pollution?},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The continuous generation of plastic wastes is one of the most serious
   environmental problems that we are facing. Information campaigns have
   been used to encourage people to reduce plastic consumption. Moreover,
   social media has become the most prevalent and influential form of
   communication in this current era. This study seeks to analyze the
   influence of social media on consumer behavior towards plastic products.
   The survey includes 213 individual observations wherein four information
   posts that represent the overall facets of plastic usage problem were
   presented. These scenarios include (1) a general information post on
   sachet use, (2) an information post discouraging use of plastic bottles
   in celebration of zero waste month, (3) an information post on the
   adverse health effects of plastic food storage and (4) an information
   post on the harmful effects of plastic use to marine life and its
   indirect effect to human health. Results show that, prior to any
   information, most participants consume products in plastic packaging
   except for the usage of single-use plastic containers for storing food.
   For the first three scenarios, it has been found that social media
   intensifies the probability of avoiding plastic consumption when the
   likelihood on the involvement of self-interest on the topic, as well as
   the ability to read the link attached to the post, increases. However,
   for the scenario that shows harmful effects of plastic use to marine
   life, the probability of avoiding the use of plastic packaged products
   after seeing the post is only affected by the likelihood that the
   respondent will recommend the link to friends or network. This study
   establishes that social media can effectively influence consumer
   behavior towards plastic consumption if the information presented are
   from confirmed studies that can easily translate to results based on
   their own action and has a direct impact on their health. The
   contrasting findings based on the different scenarios can be used as
   palettes in constructing modulated social media posts that can
   effectively influence consumer behavior towards reducing plastic
   pollution.},

Abstract = {Human activity is changing the biosphere in unprecedented ways, and
   addressing this challenge will require changes in individual and
   community patterns of behavior. One approach to managing individual
   behaviors is ``top-down{''} and involves imposing sanctions through
   legislative frameworks. However, of itself, a top-down framework does
   not appear sufficient to encourage the changes required to meet
   environmental sustainability targets. Thus, there has been interest in
   changing individual-level behavior from the ``bottom-up{''} by, for
   example, fostering desirable pro-environmental behaviors via social
   norms. Social norms arise from expectations about how others will behave
   and the consequences of conforming to or departing from them.
   Meta-analyses suggest that social norms can promote pro-environmental
   behavior. Environmental social norms that appear to have changed in
   recent decades and have themselves promoted change include recycling,
   include nascent behavioral shifts such as the move away from single-use
   plastics and flight shaming (flygskam). However, whether the conditions
   under which pro-environmental social norms emerge and are adhered to
   align with environmental systems' features is unclear. Furthermore,
   individuals might feel powerless in a global system, which can limit the
   growth and influence of pro-environmental norms. We review the
   conditions believed to promote the development of and adherence to
   social norms, then consider how those conditions relate to the
   environmental challenges of the Anthropocene. While promoting social
   norms has a valuable role in promoting pro-environmental actions, we
   conclude that norms are most likely to be effective where individual
   actions are immediately evident and have an obvious and local effect.},

Title = {Interfacial behavior of a polylactic acid active packaging film dictates
   its performance in complex food matrices},
Journal = {FOOD PACKAGING AND SHELF LIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The convergence of food wasted due to spoilage and disposal of single
   use, non-compostable plastic packaging presents a significant economic
   and environmental burden. The ongoing market trend of reducing additive
   use in foods generates an opportunity to extend shelf life through
   alternative means. Active packaging technologies which seek to extend
   `clean label' product shelf life at the post-retail level using
   bioderived polymers thus represents a unique solution in reducing
   volumes of both food and plastic municipal solid waste. An understanding
   of the active packaging interfacial behavior is necessary to predict
   performance in complex food systems. Here we present a characterization
   of the carboxylate pKa for polylactic acid (PLA) films grafted with the
   antioxidant nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), PLA-g-NTA. Attenuated total
   reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to
   determine the pKa values of 3.97 and 8.99 for the carboxylic acid groups
   of NTA and a pH dependent ABTS radical scavenging assay was performed to
   determine the pKa value of 6.74 for the tertiary amine of NTA. These
   results indicate PLA-g-NTA would be useful as an antioxidant material at
   the food interface with pH values above 6.74, as an electron transfer
   from the deprotonated tertiary amine was shown to be the largest driver
   of radical scavenging capacity. Utilizing a biodegradable antioxidant
   packaging material such as PLA-g-NTA thus gives way to protect food from
   oxidation while meeting consumer demands for reduced additive use
   towards the goal of reducing food waste and the environmental impact of
   petroleum based single-use plastics.},

Title = {Characterization and distribution of plastic particles along Alexandria
   beaches, Mediterranean Coast of Egypt, using microscopy and thermal
   analysis techniques},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {834},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) contamination has become a global concern with
   potential impacts on the marine environment. Alexandria is the
   second-largest city in Egypt and a significant contributor of plastic
   litter inputs into the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The current study
   provides an in-depth analysis of the plastic particles accumulated along
   Alexandria beaches. Types, composition, and potential sources of MPs
   were investigated using microscopy and thermal analysis. A mean value of
   389.1 +/- 285.9 items kg(-1) dry weight was detected in the shore
   sediments similar to other records from the Eastern Mediterranean
   region. An average of 457.4 +/- 281.8 items m(-3) was recorded in the
   surface water, which was the highest recorded MPs density in onshore
   waters of the Mediterranean region. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
   showed that plastics made up 0.5\% - 72\% of the materials extracted
   from the sediment samples, and 0.58\% 20.6\% from the water samples.
   Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) identified ten semi-crystalline
   polymers. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyethylene vinyl acetate
   (PEVA) were the common polymers. The single-use plastic bags and
   detergents were the land-based sources of marine plastic litter. The
   sea-based sources included antifouling paints, maintenance of ships, and
   abandoned fishing gears. Proper management plans of domestic waste
   input, polluter-pay strategy, and education programs aiming at the
   Fishermen and how plastic pollution would impact their livelihood are
   urgently needed.},

Title = {Microplastics in intertidal water of South Australia and the mussel
   Mytilus spp.; the contrasting effect of population on
   concentration},

Abstract = {Microplastics, plastic particles <5 mm in size, are of global concern as
   human-caused pollutants in marine and fresh waters, and yet little is
   known of their distribution, behaviour and ecological impact in the
   intertidal environment of South Australia. This study confirms for the
   first time, the presence of microplastic in the South Australian
   intertidal ecosystem by quantifying the abundance of particles in
   intertidal water and in the keystone species, the blue mussel, Mytilus
   spp., an important fisheries species, at ten and six locations
   respectively, along the South Australian coastline. For a remote region
   known for its pristine environment, microplastic concentration in
   intertidal water was found to be low to moderate (mean = 8.21 particles
   l(-1) +/- 4.91) relative to global levels and microplastic abundance in
   mussels (mean = 3.58 +/- 8.18 particles individual(-1)) was within the
   range also reported globally. Microplastic particles were ubiquitous
   across sites and bioavailable by size in water (mean = 906.36 mu m) and
   in mussel (mean = 983.29 mu m) raising concerns for the health of South
   Australia's unique coastal ecosystems and for the human food chain.
   Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between human coastal
   population size and microplastic concentration in intertidal water,
   irrespective of influences from industry - tourism, fishing and shipping
   ports. FTIR analysis determined plastic type to include polyamide (PA),
   polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), acrylic resin,
   polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) and cellulose, suggesting synthetic and
   semi-synthetic particles from single-use, short-life cycle products,
   fabrics, ropes and cordage. Our findings shed light on the urgent need
   to establish the local sources of microplastic pollution in order to
   assist the community, industry and government to reduce the impact of
   microplastic on the fragile marine systems within South Australian
   intertidal waters and on the organisms associated with the human food
   chain.},

   marine litter? Insights from a choice experiment in England and Ireland},

Abstract = {Marine litter is a problem impacting the coasts and seas of the whole
   world. Whilst an increasing number of studies investigate the effects of
   marine litter on public welfare, most of the research to date considers
   it as a component of coastal environmental quality. This study
   specifically examines the preferences and willingness to pay of English
   and Irish respondents towards the removal and prevention of marine
   litter, and the trade-off between different short-term (e.g., beach
   clean-up) and long-term (e.g., ban on single use plastic) policy
   actions. An online survey, including a choice experiment and behavioural
   questions, was used to quantify the welfare impacts of marine litter on
   the provision of recreation and cultural ecosystem services. We found
   that respondents are generally inclined to the implementation of a
   policy mix, with propensity for immediate action. Our results confirm
   the loss of societal benefits due to the presence of marine litter on
   beaches. The estimated marginal willingness to pay can be used to inform
   the design and assess costs and benefits of new local, national or
   supra-national mixed policies directed at reducing litter in the coastal
   and marine environment.},

   using non-traditional toxicity data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {445},
Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {Microplastic pollution has become a major environmental problem,
   indicating the need to implement quanti-tative governance standards in
   combination with reducing or banning single-use plastic. Previous
   studies have predicted no-effect concentrations for limited
   microplastic-based toxicity data but have not considered
   envi-ronmentally relevant sizes, shapes, or polymers. To provide high
   quantity and quality data for microplastics of different sizes, shapes,
   or polymer compositions, non-traditional and traditional toxicity data
   may need to be considered in combination. In this study, we reviewed
   toxicity data for microplastics in freshwaters from 2018 to 2022 and
   analyzed the toxicity data using traditional and non-traditional
   methods. Based on 166 chronic traditional toxicity data points, the
   hazard concentration (HC) values calculated from non-traditional
   toxicity endpoints or all toxicity endpoints were lower than those
   calculated from traditional toxicity endpoints. Based on 398 chronic
   traditional plus non-traditional toxicity data points, the HC values
   calculated from traditional plus non-traditional values were higher than
   those calculated from traditional toxicity values. With these results,
   we developed a new framework for deriving microplastic-specific
   hazardous concentrations, one that especially considers non-traditional
   toxicity endpoints and values for microplastics. Overall, this study
   offers a basis for future management strategies and associated
   frameworks for mitigating microplastic toxicity.},

Title = {Performance and optimisation study of waste plastic aggregate based
   sustainable concrete - A machine learning approach},
Journal = {CLEANER WASTE SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The use of waste plastic made aggregates in cement concrete not only can
   solve the problem of the disposal of waste plastics in a sustainable way
   but also it reduces the necessity of extracting natural aggregates,
   which causes erosion and environmental degradation. Therefore,
   feasibility of the usage of single used plastic (PET and PE) made
   aggregates in M20 and M25 grade cement concrete as partial replacement
   of natural coarse and fine aggregate were studied in this research work
   with 8 volumetric substitution levels (5 \%, 10 \%, 15 \%, 20 \%, 25 \%,
   30 \%, 35 \%, and 40 \%) The influence of substitution on fresh and
   hardened properties of concrete was assessed by analyzing workability,
   wet and dry density, compressive strength at different ages and split
   tensile strength. The experimental results indicate that both the
   densities decrease about 10 \% and workability increases about 60 \%
   with increase in the ratio of plastic aggregate. Compressive strength
   and split tensile strength decrease with increase in plastic replacement
   upto 14 \% and 34 \% respectively. Based on the experimental results
   models were developed using four different Machine learning (ML)
   techniques namely ANN, FL, ANFIS and GA to predict the workability,
   density and compressive strength of the waste plastic aggregate based
   concrete. The result clearly signifies that the ANFIS model yields the
   best result (R-2 = 0.98) for predicting the properties of concrete
   accurately. Furthermore, GA based multi-objective optimization models
   were developed using different aggregates for obtaining concrete with
   maximum workability and compressive strength along with minimum density
   and cost.},

Abstract = {The demand for packaging materials with low gas permeabilities is
   increasing, but commonly used petroleum-derived single-use plastics are
   not renewable, biodegradable, or easy to recycle. Nanomaterials composed
   of chitin and cellulose, which are abundant in nature, have high
   crystallinities and low oxygen permeabilities (OPs), providing a viable
   alternative. In this work, we explore how deacetylation conditions of
   crab shell chitin can be used to tune the charge and size of the
   resulting chitin nanowhiskers (ChNWs) and the resulting OP of layered
   film structures. Three deacetylation factors, the concentration of
   sodium hydroxide (\% NaOH), temperature (T), and reaction time, were
   explored using a three-factor three-level Taguchi design with an
   orthogonal array. The resulting ChNW suspensions were sequentially
   spray-coated with suspensions of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) onto
   cellulose acetate (CA) films to form a multilayer structure. We show
   that ChNWs prepared under more aggressive deacetylation conditions
   inside the original orthogonal array (higher \% NaOH, T, and time) had
   shorter lengths but the surface charge was significantly influenced only
   by more aggressive deacetylation outside of the original design
   conditions. With only similar to 10\% decrease in the ultimate tensile
   strength and no significant loss in failure strain, the ChNW-CNC coating
   resulted in similar to 20\% decrease in the water vapor transmission
   rate in comparison to uncoated CA films. The optimization of process
   conditions resulted in CA-ChNW-CNC films with a 91-99\% decrease in OP
   (132-16.7 cm(3).mu m/m(2)/day/kPa vs 1553 cm(3).mu m/m(2)/day/kPa for
   uncoated CA).},

Abstract = {Plastic has contributed enormously to the healthcare sector and towards
   public health safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the frequent
   usage of plastic-based personal protective equipment (PPEs) (including
   face masks, gloves, protective body suits, aprons, gowns, face shields,
   surgical masks, and goggles), by frontline health workers, there has
   been a tremendous increase in their manufacture and distribution.
   Different types of plastic polymers are used in the manufacture of this
   equipment, depending upon their usage. However, since a majority of
   these plastics are still single-use plastics (SUP), they are not at all
   eco-friendly and end up generating large quantities of plastic waste.
   The overview presents the various available and practiced methods in
   vogue for disposal cum treatment of these highly contaminated plastic
   wastes. Among the current methods of plastic waste disposal,
   incineration and land filling are the most common ones, but both these
   methods have their negative impacts on the environment. Alongside,
   numerous methods that can be used to sterilize them before any treatment
   have been discussed. There are several new sorting technologies, to help
   produce purer polymers that can be made to undergo thermal or chemical
   treatments. Microbial degradation is one such novel method that is under
   the spotlight currently and being studied extensively, because of its
   ecological advantages, cost-effectiveness, ease of use, and maintenance.
   In addition to the deliberations on the methods, strategies have been
   enumerated for combination of different methods, vis-a-vis studying the
   life cycle assessment towards a more circular economy in handling this
   menace to protect mankind.},

Abstract = {In this work, we report a facile preparation of biocomposites using a
   chitosan maim that is reinforced with morphed graphene in amounts from 1
   to 5 wt \% C. The composites are processed by milling and conventional
   sintering. The morphed graphene additions show clear improvements in
   mechanical properties, having a direct correlation with temperature in
   particular for 180 degrees C. Higher temperatures are detrimental to
   chitosan and the properties drop because chitosan degrades. Mechanical
   properties in the composite such as yield strength and compressive
   strength increase between 40 and 50\% with respect to the pure chitosan
   samples. The Young's modulus presents a drop of approximately 10\%, but
   the fracture toughness increases up to 3.5 fold. The properties of our
   sustainable composites are comparable to those seen in polymers such as
   polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon, and poly(methyl methacrylate), among
   other commodity or single use plastics. The enhancement in the
   mechanical properties is attributed to the morphed graphene embedded
   chitosan matrix that generates a network of intergranular ``anchors{''}
   that hold the chitosan crystals in place, preventing failure. The
   composites can be molded into near-net-shape products, machined, or
   shaped using various methods including laser lithography. These studies
   demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating biocomposites with different
   architectures and sizes for disposable structural components. Both
   chitosan and the composites are compostable and biodegradable with the
   potential to sustain plant growth when discarded. In addition, morphed
   graphene and chitosan are produced from byproducts or waste, which may
   result in a negative carbon footprint on the environment.},

Title = {Design, implementation and assessment of a more sustainable model to
   manage plastic waste at sport events},

Abstract = {The implementation and assessment of sustainable initiatives at sport
   events has a great importance for researchers and practitioners to
   improve the effects on the hosting territory. All three pillars of
   sustainability (environmental, economic and social) must be considered.
   In running events, such as marathons, one of the main issues is the
   environmental impact of the great quantity of waste, and particularly of
   plastic waste. A recent tendency is to shift to a ``plastic-free{''}
   model. However, some single-use plastic products have unrivalled
   properties and their replacement with other materials may not be the
   most sustainable solution, at least in the short term. In this paper, a
   new model for managing plastic waste at a marathon is proposed. It does
   not aim to eliminate plastics at sport events, but to better manage
   waste by increasing collection, and sorting and recycling efficiency,
   following the circular economy paradigm. To demonstrate the
   sustainability of the model, a precise and quantitative methodology is
   applied to an innovative visualisation tool, developed by the University
   of Bologna, to assess circular initiatives and some key performance
   indicators (KPIs) to compare the sustainability of the new model to
   waste management in the previous editions of the same event. With this
   approach, it is demonstrated that a marathon can be completely
   sustainable: (i) from an environmental point of view, plastic collection
   efficiency increased by 120.5\%; the recycling rate by 157.0\% and the
   landfill rate decreased by 75.4\%; (ii) from an economic point of view,
   it was demonstrated that, with the technological level of the involved
   recycling plant, the initiative is cost-effective when the virgin PET
   price is greater than (sic)776/tonne; and (iii) with regard to the
   social impact, it was proved that the direct engagement of participants
   (runners and walkers) and their positive perceptions about the
   initiative achieved the highest score for the two selected qualitative
   KPIs (3/3). Moreover, some insights have been derived to improve plastic
   management, covering different disciplines: technical standardisation of
   plastics, consumer training and legislative support for technological
   innovation in the industrial context. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by

   communication of the project (press conference, communication on social
   media, volunteers' T-shirts) and in particular Siropack Italia s. r.l.
   (a member of Romagna Iniziative) and TAILOR Laboratory, which
   contributed significantly to the conception of the initiative and to the
   involvement of partners and the supply of the equipment necessary to
   implement the initiative (bins, communication panel, reverse logistics
   costs, personnel). We would like to thank Maratona Alzheimer for being
   our case study and providing the data and information. All three
   partners were involved in the recruitment of the dedicated volunteers.
   Other partners provided their resources to conduct activities for the
   initiative and to provide data: Ilpa Group (plastic manufacturer and
   recycler); Hera Group (multi-utility); and Corepla (Italian Consortium
   for plastic waste management). Finally, the authors acknowledge the EIT
   ClimateKIC, which funded the project Prosumer
   (EIT\_2.2.2\_200103\_P125\_1A) providing the opportunity to consolidate
   and disseminate the proposed methodology.},

Title = {Challenges and strategies for effective plastic waste management during
   and post COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has enhanced the complexities of
   plastic waste management. Our improved, hyper-hygienic way of life in
   the fear of transmission has conveniently shifted our behavioral
   patterns like the use of PPE (Personal protective equipment), increased
   demand for plastic-packaged food and groceries, and the use of
   disposable utensils. The inadequacies and inefficiencies of our current
   waste management system to deal with the increased dependence on plastic
   could aggravate its mismanagement and leakage into the environment, thus
   triggering a new environmental crisis. Mandating scientific
   sterilization and the use of sealed bags for safe disposal of
   contaminated plastic wastes should be an immediate priority to reduce
   the risk of transmission to sanitation workers. Investments in circular
   technologies like feedstock recycling, improving the infrastructure and
   environmental viability of existing techniques could be the key to
   dealing with the plastic waste fluxes during such a crisis. Transition
   towards environmentally friendly materials like bioplastics and
   harboring new sustainable technologies would be crucial to fighting
   future pandemics. Although the rollbacks and relaxation of single-use
   plastic bans may be temporary, their likely implications on the consumer
   perception could hinder our long-term goals of transitioning towards a
   circular economy. Likewise, any delay in building international
   willingness and participation to curb any form of pollution through
   summits and agendas may also delay its implementation. Reduction in
   plastic pollution and at the same time promoting sustainable plastic
   waste management technologies can be achieved by prioritizing our
   policies to instill individual behavioral as well as social,
   institutional changes. Incentivizing measures that encourage circularity
   and sustainable practices, and public-private investments in research,
   infrastructure and marketing would help in bringing the aforementioned
   changes. Individual responsibility, corporate action, and government
   policy are all necessary to keep us from transitioning from one disaster
   to another. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {What material flow analysis and life cycle assessment reveal about
   plastic polymer production and recycling in South Africa},

Abstract = {Global production and consumption of plastics have increased
   significantly in recent years. The environmental impacts associated with
   this trend have received growing attention internationally with
   single-use plastic packaging responsible for most plastic pollution.
   Locally, the SA Plastics Pact, the Industry Master Plan, and the
   National Waste Management Strategy all aim to transform the current
   linear sector model into a circular system by setting targets for
   increased collection and recycling rates and recycled content. However,
   the associated impacts of implementing such circular interventions have
   not yet been assessed across the plastics life cycle. Industrial ecology
   tools, material flow analysis and life cycle assessment, are used to
   generate mass-based indicators as well as indicators of climate damage
   in the form of the global warming potential. The carbon footprint of the
   South African plastics value chain from cradle to grave was estimated at
   17.9 Mt CO(2)eq emissions in 2018, with 52\% of these due to the local
   coal-based monomer production process. The end-of-life stage lacks
   proper waste collection for a third of the population, but contributes
   only 2\% to the total greenhouse gas emissions, with recycling having a
   minimal environmental impact. Future projections of plastics production,
   use, disposal, and recycling for 2025 show that increasing mechanical
   recycling rates to achieve stated targets would start to have a
   significant effect on virgin polymer demand (in the order of several
   billion rands of sales annually) but would also reduce waste disposal by
   28\% relative to baseline growth and 18\% below values calculated for
   2018.
   Significance:
   Despite increased attention, the flows and resulting life cycle-based
   carbon footprint of the plastics sector have not been evaluated on a
   local scale.
   The carbon footprint of the South African plastics industry is sizeable
   at almost 18 Mt CO(2)eq per annum with emissions strongly associated
   with the linear rather than the circular stages of the value chain.
   The impacts of a key circular economy intervention, namely increased
   recycling rates to achieve set targets include demand reduction for
   virgin polymer to the tune of several billion rands.},

Title = {Unlocking the surge in demand for personal and protective equipment
   (PPE) and improvised face coverings arising from coronavirus disease
   (COVID-19) pandemic - Implications for efficacy, re-use and sustainable
   waste management},

Abstract = {Currently, there is no effective vaccine for tackling the ongoing
   COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 with the occurrence of repeat
   waves of infection frequently stretching hospital resources beyond
   capacity. Disease countermeasures rely upon preventing person-to-person
   transmission of SARS-CoV2 so as to protect front-line healthcare workers
   (HCWs). COVID-19 brings enormous challenges in terms of sustaining the
   supply chain for single-use-plastic personal and protective equipment
   (PPE). Post-COVID-19, the changes in medical practice will drive high
   demand for PPE. Important countermeasures for preventing COVID-19
   transmission include mitigating potential high risk aerosol transmission
   in healthcare setting using medical PPE (such as filtering facepiece
   respirators (FFRs)) and the appropriate use of face coverings by the
   general public that carries a lower transmission risk. PPE reuse is a
   potential short term solution during COVID-19 pandemic where there is
   increased evidence for effective deployment of reprocessing methods such
   as vaporized hydrogen peroxide (30 to 35\% VH2O2) used alone or combined
   with ozone, ultraviolet light at 254 nm (2000 mJ/cm(2)) and moist heat
   (60 degrees C at high humidity for 60 min). Barriers to PPE reuse
   include potentially trust and acceptance by HCWs. Efficacy of face
   coverings are influenced by the appropriate wearing to cover the nose
   and mouth, type of material used, number of layers, duration of wearing,
   and potentially superior use of ties over ear loops. Insertion of a nose
   clip into cloth coverings may help with maintaining fit. Use of 60
   degrees C for 60 min (such as, use domestic washing machine and spin
   dryer) has been advocated for face covering decontamination. Risk of
   virus infiltration in improvised face coverings is potentially increased
   by duration of wearing due to humidity, liquid diffusion and virus
   retention. Future sustained use of PPE will be influenced by the
   availability of recyclable PPE and by innovative biomedical waste
   management. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The complex composition of waste electrical and electronic equipment
   (WEEE) plastics represents a challenge during post-consumption plastic
   recycling. A single WEEE category, e.g. large household appliances
   (LHA), can contain several different plastic types with overlapping
   material properties, making the sorting of individual plastics a
   challenge. Significant increases in plastic recovery rates can be
   expected by clustering product categories, as clustering can avoid
   mixing of non-compatible plastics with overlapping material properties.
   For this purpose, a life cycle assessment (LCA) is conducted to
   investigate the influence of different clustering strategies on the
   environmental performance of waste treatment and the production of
   recycled plastic from LHA waste stream. To assure comparability between
   waste treatment scenarios a system expansion approach is applied, and to
   allocate the burden of shared processes over the first and second use
   cycle of the material partitioning is applied. Results show that an
   increased separation of product clusters by plastic type can improve the
   plastic recovery rate from 5.8\% to 47.1\% and reduce the overall
   environmental impact, quantified with the ReCiPe (2016) method, by up to
   23\%. The environmental impacts of using recycled plastics from LHA
   waste can be reduced by 27 to 38\% compared to single-use plastic. The
   holistic approach used in this study demonstrates (1) the potential
   benefits of implementing product clustering strategies for LHA plastic
   recycling, (2) the relevance of different allocation procedures when
   integrating recycling into an LCA, (3) the importance of using less
   virgin material and avoiding final waste treatment, and (4) the
   limitation of the recycling system to reduce the environmental burden
   associated with products. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The study focuses on analyzing the presence and quantity of
   microplastics near an unscientific solid waste dumping site located at
   Kochi city in India and thereby assessing the contribution of massive
   open dumping towards microplastic pollution in the river. Two sets of
   sampling with three sediment samples from nearby Kadambrayar river and
   five topsoil samples from various parts of the Brahmapuram waste dumping
   yard were carried out during January - February 2019. The samples were
   analyzed as per the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   (US NOAA) protocol. ATR-FTIR and DSC analysis based characterization
   indicated that polyethylene dominated the micro plastics followed by
   polypropylene and polystyrene. The size distribution of particles showed
   that comparatively larger particles of size range between 2.36 - 4.75 mm
   were present in the topsoil than that in river sediments which had more
   number of particles in size range below 2.36 mm. The study confirmed the
   presence of an average of 100 microplastic pieces per 100 gram of
   sediments of Kadambrayar river bordering the waste dumping yard at
   Brahmapuram. The topsoil of Brahmapuram waste dumping yard was found to
   contain 178 pieces of microplastics per 100 gm of soil. Microplastics
   are found to be high in the river stretch near the open dumping site
   which has a significant role in the pollution, causing a major threat to
   the entire ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Healthcare waste management is regarded as the most critical concern
   that the entire world is currently and will be confronted with in the
   near future. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the significant growth in
   medical waste frightened the globe, prompting it to investigate safe
   disposal methods. Plastics are developing as a severe environmental
   issue as a result of their increased use during the COVID-19 pandemic
   which has triggered a global catastrophe and prompted concerns about
   plastic waste management. One of the biggest challenges in this
   circumstance is the disposal of discarded PPE kits. The purpose of this
   research is to find a viable disposal treatment procedure for enhanced
   personal protective equipment (PPE) (facemasks, gloves, and other
   protective equipment) and other single-use plastic medical equipment
   waste in India during the COVID-19 crises, which will aid in effectively
   reducing their increasing quantity. To analyse the PPE waste disposal
   problem in India, we used the fuzzy Measurement Alternatives and Ranking
   according to the Compromise Solution (MARCOS) technique, which included
   the dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy set. The fuzzy Best Worst
   Method (BWM), which is compatible with the existing MCDM approaches, is
   used to establish the criteria weights. Sensitivity and comparative
   analyses are utilised to confirm the stability and validity of the
   proposed strategy.},

Title = {Retailer Volunteerism as a Plastic Shopping Bag Governance Tool:
   Shoppers' Reflections and Contributions to Environmental Social
   Marketing},

Abstract = {Introduction: The pollution of landscapes and coastal environments with
   plastic shopping bag litter is an escalating global problem. The
   introduction of plastic bag tax aimed at addressing this challenge
   achieved limited success in South Africa. This study explores South
   African shoppers' perceptions towards social marketing anchored retailer
   voluntary initiatives, which is an emerging plastic bag policy option.
   Literature: Adverse environmental and social effects of plastic shopping
   bags are discussed. Retailer voluntary initiatives used to de-market
   plastic shopping bags, including jurisdictions where they were
   implemented, are also reviewed. The focus is on retailer anti-plastic
   bag initiatives such as `reusable shopping bags' and `plastic bag-free'
   shops.
   Methods: This study is situated within a constructivist research
   paradigm and a qualitative methodology. Data were collected from a
   sample of 31 grocery shoppers recruited from retailer outlets in South
   Africa's metropolitan cities, Johannesburg and Pretoria. In-depth
   interviews were conducted to explore shoppers' perceptions towards
   retailer-driven anti-plastic bag voluntary initiatives. Thematic content
   analysis was used to analyse interview data.
   Findings: The findings of this study highlight shoppers' negative
   perceptions towards retailer anti-plastic bag voluntary initiatives.
   Shoppers perceived retailer anti-plastic bag voluntary initiatives as
   forms of green capitalism, green entrepreneurship, symbolic corporate
   social responsibility, strategic business posture, commandeered green
   consumerism, measured environmental morality, masked green washing and
   calculated pre-emptive behaviour. Future studies may seek to extend the
   generalisability of these findings by using a larger sample size.
   Conclusion: The study's findings highlight the trust deficit associated
   with retailer anti-plastic bags voluntary initiatives and the importance
   of enhancing market acceptance and legitimacy. Mistrust and cynicism
   directed towards retailer anti-plastic bag voluntary initiatives point
   to the importance of consumer education aimed at emphasising the
   negative effects of single-use plastic shopping bags. This study
   concludes that reliance on retailer self-regulation may not be the best
   approach to solve the escalating problem of plastic bag litter. We argue
   that national governments need to implement interventions that strike a
   balance between environmental sustainability and economic development.},

Title = {Role of protected area in reducing marine and plastic litter: A case
   study from India's first Marine Protected Area and comparison with
   Non-Protected Areas},

Abstract = {This research is the first to assess marine litter and plastic pollution
   in India's first marine protected area (MPA), the Gulf of Kachchh Marine
   Protected Area (GOKMPA). We compare it to two non-protected areas, that
   is, Okha Beach and Beyt Dwarka, known for their high industrial and
   tourist activity, respectively. Standing-stock surveys were used to
   collect primary litter data, while questionnaire surveys were used to
   learn about people's perception and attitude towards the plastic
   pollution problem in the study area. We found that plastic was the most
   common component of the litter at all the sites and that it was
   primarily of terrestrial origin. Compared to non-protected sites, GOKMPA
   had the lowest litter density but the highest proportion of plastic
   litter. Single-use plastic bottles were the most counted items at all
   the sites, regardless of the conservation status of the sites. The
   majority of people (locals, visitors, and fishers) around these sites
   expressed concern about waste but were hesitant to take responsibility
   and discourage or prevent littering. We noted that designating coastal
   territories as protected areas helps in reducing plastic pollution while
   also conserving habitat and biodiversity. However, this could change
   rapidly due to either mishandling of litter within MPAs or neighboring
   non-PAs, and also because plastics pose an actual toxicity risk when
   present even at minimal concentrations in the environment. We recommend
   combining preventive, mitigating, and curative measures in areas where
   risk hotspots for plastic litter are identified, and such sites must be
   constantly monitored. Long-term solutions could include transitioning
   from a linear to a circular economy, which would involve goals for
   reducing plastic waste and instituting more sustainable production and
   consumption patterns.},

Title = {Mangroves in the ``Plasticene{''}: High exposure of coastal mangroves to
   anthropogenic litter pollution along the Central-West coast of India},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {858},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic litter isa ubiquitous stressor in the global ocean, and
   poses ominous threats to oceanic biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
   At the terrestrial-ocean interface, tropical mangrove forests are
   subject to substantial exposure to mismanaged litter from inland and
   marine sources. While the effects of litter in different marine
   ecosystems are well-documented, research on the ecological consequences
   of litter pollution on mangroves remain nascent stage. Here, we
   investigated anthropogenic litter concentration, composition, probable
   sources, and impact on coastal mangroves along the Central West coast of
   India. The mean concentration of trapped litter was measured 8.5 +/- 1.9
   items/m(2) (ranged 1.4- 26.9 items/m(2)), and 10.6 +/- 0.5 items/tree
   (ranged 0- 85 items/tree) on the mangrove floor and mangrove canopy,
   respectively. Plastic dominated 83.02 \% of all litter deposited on the
   mangrove forest floor and 93.4 \% of all entangled litter on mangrove
   canopy. Most litter comprised single-use plastic products across all
   surveyed locations. Mangrove floor cleanliness was assessed using
   several indices, such as Clean Coast Index, General Index, Hazardous
   Items Index, and Pollution Load Index, reiterating an inferior
   cleanliness status. The pollution load index indicates ``Hazard level
   I{''} plastic pollution risk across the mangroves. Litter concentration
   differed markedly across all sites. However, a significantly higher
   concentration of stranded litter was detected in the densely populated
   urban agglomeration and rural areas with inadequate solid waste
   management. Probable sources of litter indicate land-based (local) and
   sea-originated (fishing). Supportive information on the transport and
   accumulation of marine litter is examined based on the National Centers
   for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System (CFS) model
   version 2 reanalysis of surface wind and current pattern across the
   Arabian Sea followed by MIKE simulated tide-induced coastal current.
   Mangrove pneumatophores and branches were found to be damaged by
   entangled plastics. Hence, determining litter quantum and their probable
   input source is pivotal in mitigating anthropogenic litter impact on
   mangrove ecosystems and fostering mangrove conservation. Overall,
   results envisage that stringent enforcement, implementation of an
   integrated solid waste management framework, and general behavioral
   change of the public are crucial to mitigate litter/plastic pollution.},

Abstract = {Single-use plastic production is higher now than ever before. Much of
   this plastic is released into aquatic environments, where it is
   eventually weathered into smaller nanoscale plastics. In addition to
   potential direct biological effects, nanoplastics may also modulate the
   biological effects of hydrophobic persistent organic legacy contaminants
   (POPs) that absorb to their surfaces. In this study, we test the
   hypothesis that developmental exposure (0-7 dpf) of zebrafish to the
   emerging contaminant polystyrene (PS) nanoplastics (100 nm; 2.5 or 25
   ppb), or to environmental levels of the legacy contaminant and flame
   retardant 2,2 `,4,4 `-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47; 10 ppt), disrupt
   organismal energy metabolism. We also test the hypothesis that
   co-exposure leads to increased metabolic disruption. The uptake of
   nanoplastics in developing zebrafish was validated using fluorescence
   microscopy. To address metabolic consequences at the organismal and
   molecular level, metabolic phenotyping assays and metabolic gene
   expression analysis were used. Both PS and BDE-47 affected organismal
   metabolism alone and in combination. Individually, PS and BDE-47
   exposure increased feeding and oxygen consumption rates. PS exposure
   also elicited complex effects on locomotor behaviour with increased
   long-distance and decreased short-distance movements. Co-exposure of PS
   and BDE-47 significantly increased feeding and oxygen consumption rates
   compared to control and individual compounds alone, suggesting additive
   or synergistic effects on energy balance, which was further supported by
   reduced neutral lipid reserves. Conversely, molecular gene expression
   data pointed to a negative interaction, as co-exposure of high PS
   generally abolished the induction of gene expression in response to
   BDE-47. Our results demonstrate that co-exposure to emerging nanoplastic
   contaminants and legacy contaminants results in cumulative metabolic
   disruption in early development in a fish model relevant to eco- and
   human toxicology.},

Abstract = {Since the start of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
   (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) pandemic in December 2019, there have been global
   surges of single-use plastic use. Due to the importance of personal
   protective equipment (PPE) and sanitation items in protecting against
   virus transmission and from testing, facemasks, respirators, disposable
   gloves and disposable wet wipes have become global staples in households
   and institutions. Widespread use and insufficient infrastructure,
   combined with improper waste management have resulted in an emerging
   category of litter. With widespread presence in the environment, such
   items pose a direct threat to wildlife as animals can interact with them
   in a series of ways. We examined the scope of COVID-19 pandemic-related
   debris, including PPE and san-itation items, on wildlife from April 2020
   to December 2021. We document the geographic occurrence of incidents,
   debris types, and consequences of incidents that were obtained from
   social media searches, unpublished reports from colleagues, and reports
   available from the citizen science database ``Birds and Debris{''}.
   There were 114 unique sightings of wildlife interactions with
   pandemic-related debris (38 from 2020 and 76 from 2021). Within the
   context of this dataset, most incidents involved birds (83.3 \%), while
   fewer affected mammals (10.5 \%), invertebrates (3.5 \%), fish (1.8 \%),
   and sea turtles (0.9 \%). Sightings originated in 23 countries, and
   consisted mostly of entanglements (42.1 \%) and nest incorporations
   (40.4 \%). We verified sightings by contacting the original observers
   and were able to identify replicated sightings and increase the
   resolution of the data collected compared with previously published
   results. Due to the complexities associated with global use and
   accessibility of digital platforms, we likely underestimate the number
   of animals harmed by debris. Overall, the global scope of this study
   demonstrates that on-line and social media platforms are a valuable way
   to collect biologically relevant citizen science data and track rapidly
   emerging environmental challenges.},

Title = {GRETA//A PLASTIC POEM: An Integrated Approach to the Vibrant Matter of

Abstract = {Through an analysis of the sonic performance artwork GRETA//A PLASTIC
   POEM (2020), this paper analyzes why and when participatory art
   practices can intra-sect and converge with ecologies to imagine
   posthuman futures and challenge pre-existing structures of thought. From
   an activist position that considers art and the environment as a
   participatory collective model, this article argues for a reappraisal of
   human influence in complex human-non-human interactional systems. More
   specifically, this text, as a component of GRETA//A PLASTIC POEM,
   approaches oceanic and sea pollution (notably the dumping of plastics)
   as a form of environmental degradation that has generated a space
   inhabited by varied and vibrant forms of matter. In this way, the sea
   and the sonic space show strikingly similar potentials. In turn, Plastic
   Activism, which advocates for a world free of plastic pollution and its
   toxic impacts, is adopted as an underlying ethos and aesthetic response,
   with single-use plastics being incorporated into the performance artwork
   itself. Relational to this enquiry is sensing how we use our bodies to
   explore the potential thousands of distinct material ecologies embodying
   a sonic performative practice, especially combining the materiality of
   artistic and political action in public space and focal practices. In
   this way, the sonic space becomes comparable to a sea of sound, where
   complex assemblages of matter exist and intra-act to challenge the
   discordant systems and dynamics in which we are currently entangled.},

Title = {The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic in hospital: An insight into
   environmental surfaces contamination, disinfectants' efficiency, and
   estimation of plastic waste production},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {202},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The current COVID-19 pandemic that is caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led all
   the people around the globe to implement preventive measures such as
   environmental cleaning using alcohol-based materials, and social
   distancing in order to prevent and minimize viral transmission via
   fomites. The role of environmental surface contamination in viral
   transmission in within hospital wards is still debatable, especially
   considering the spread of new variants of the virus in the world. The
   present comprehensive study aims to investigate environmental surface
   contamination in different wards of a hospital as well as the efficacy
   of two common disinfectants for virus inactivation, and tries to produce
   an estimate of plastic residue pollution as an environmental side effect
   of the pandemic. With regard to environmental surface contamination, 76
   samples were taken from different wards of the hospital, from which 40
   were positive. These samples were taken from contaminated environmental
   surfaces such as patient bed handles, the nursing station, toilet door
   handles, cell phones, patient toilet sinks, toilet bowls, and patient's
   pillows, which are regularly-touched surfaces and can pose a high risk
   for transmission of the virus. The number of positive samples also
   reveals that SARS-CoV-2 can survive on inanimate surfaces after
   disinfection by ethanol 70 \% and sodium hypochlorite (0.001 \%). The
   results correspond to the time that the VOC 202012/01 (lineage B.1.1.7)
   had emerged in the hospital and this should be considered that this
   variant could possibly have different traits, characteristics, and level
   of persistence in the environment. The plastic waste as an environmental
   side effect of the pandemic was also investigated and it was confirmed
   that the amount of plastic residue for a single (RT) PCR confirmatory
   test for COVID-19 diagnosis is 821.778 g of plastic residue/ test. As a
   result, it is recommended that for improving plastic waste management
   programs, considering challenges such as minimizing plastic waste
   pollution, optimization of gas control technologies in incinerators,
   process redesign, reduction of single-use plastics and PPE, etc. Is of
   utmost importance.},

Title = {Carbon Footprint of General, Regional, and Combined Anesthesia for Total
   Knee Replacements},

Abstract = {Background: Health care itself contributes to climate change. Anesthesia
   is a ``carbon hotspot,{''} yet few data exist to compare anesthetic
   choices. The authors examined the carbon dioxide equivalent emissions
   associated with general anesthesia, spinal anesthesia, and combined
   (general and spinal anesthesia) during a total knee replacement.
   Methods: A prospective life cycle assessment of 10 patients in each of
   three groups undergoing knee replacements was conducted in Melbourne,
   Australia. The authors collected input data for anesthetic items, gases,
   and drugs, and electricity for patient warming and anesthetic machine.
   Sevoflurane or propofol was used for general anesthesia. Life cycle
   assessment software was used to convert inputs to their carbon footprint
   (in kilogram carbon dioxide equivalent emissions), with modeled
   international comparisons. Results: Twenty-nine patients were studied.
   The carbon dioxide equivalent emissions for general anesthesia were an
   average 14.9 (95\% CI, 9.7 to 22.5) kg carbon dioxide equivalent
   emissions; spinal anesthesia, 16.9 (95\% CI, 13.2 to 20.5) kg carbon
   dioxide equivalent; and for combined anesthesia, 18.5 (95\% CI, 12.5 to
   27.3) kg carbon dioxide equivalent. Major sources of carbon dioxide
   equivalent emissions across all approaches were as follows: electricity
   for the patient air warmer (average at least 2.5 kg carbon dioxide
   equivalent {[}20\% total]), single-use items, 3.6 (general anesthesia),
   3.4 (spinal), and 4.3 (combined) kg carbon dioxide equivalent emissions,
   respectively (approximately 25\% total). For the general anesthesia and
   combined groups, sevoflurane contributed an average 4.7 kg carbon
   dioxide equivalent (35\% total) and 3.1 kg carbon dioxide equivalent
   (19\%), respectively. For spinal and combined, washing and sterilizing
   reusable items contributed 4.5 kg carbon dioxide equivalent (29\% total)
   and 4.1 kg carbon dioxide equivalent (24\%) emissions, respectively.
   Oxygen use was important to the spinal anesthetic carbon footprint (2.8
   kg carbon dioxide equivalent, 18\%). Modeling showed that intercountry
   carbon dioxide equivalent emission variability was less than intragroup
   variability (minimum/maximum). Conclusions: All anesthetic approaches
   had similar carbon footprints (desflurane and nitrous oxide were not
   used for general anesthesia). Rather than spinal being a default low
   carbon approach, several choices determine the final carbon footprint:
   using low-flow anesthesia/total intravenous anesthesia, reducing
   single-use plastics, reducing oxygen flows, and collaborating with
   engineers to augment energy efficiency/renewable electricity.},

Abstract = {Finding ways to restore the environmental balance that has been
   disturbed by the rise in the use of plastic commodities is urgent for
   researchers and the wider community. It is imperative that the
   increasing amount of plastic waste and the high amount of petrochemical
   resources consumed during the constant replacement of single-use
   plastics be reduced. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the
   most commonly produced single-use polymers in the world, and its
   mechanical recycling is challenging due to the loss of properties during
   reprocessing. Chemical recycling is a feasible alternative to reclaim
   the monomers, however, its viability relies on establishing a
   straightforward, fast, and inexpensive procedure to turn the end-of-use
   polymer into new pure monomers. This work reports on the fastest known
   procedure for PET chemical recycling to produce terephthalic acid and
   ethylene glycol in an efficient and straightforward manner, thanks to
   microwave-assisted heating that permitted 100\% PET conversion into TPA
   in just 1 minute at 120 degrees C. The depolymerization kinetics of this
   new procedure were studied and its improved efficiency over other
   reported hydrolysis procedures was attributed to a thicker shrinking
   layer. This new procedure may form a major breakthrough in chemical
   depolymerization. Evidence pointing to the higher reactivity of free OH
   species enabled us also to obtain dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) through
   the use of an anhydrous depolymerization system that is able to convert
   PET into DMT in 4 min at 80 degrees C, but requiring careful humidity
   control. The activation energy for the proposed depolymerization system
   was estimated as 120 kJ mol(-1). An additional advantage of the proposed
   process is the production of potassium sulfate as a side-product, a
   valuable fertilizer with high market value. This product compensates for
   the lack of recoverability of the catalyst. Our KOH-in-methanol
   hydrolysis (KMH) process has the potential to become a widely used
   depolymerization solution for a wide range of (heterogeneous)
   condensation polymers, which is currently under study by our research
   group.},
